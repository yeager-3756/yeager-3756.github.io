  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Unless you just crawled out from under a rock, you’ve heard the recent
NSA revelation they’ve been spying on Americans for years. Some hail the
latest technique to keep the Fatherland secure, others see a creepy
failure of elected officials to defend the Constitution.</p>
<p>However, if you’re a regular reader (and if you’re not, consider joining
our <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/page/newsletter.html">newsletter</a>), you know we’re
not so interested in the news for news itself, but rather how it all
works in a Biblical manner.</p>
<p>In this case, the end is near!</p>
<p>Before the tin-foil hat brigade jumps in, no, we’re not conspiracy guys,
911 truthers, or anything of the sort. We’re not advocating running away
to the mountains to hide from black helicopters.</p>
<p>No, we simply watch what <em>is</em> going on — no tin-foil had required.
Unless you’re a person who <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/09/matrix-guide-christianity.html">denies reality</a>,
it’s time to get prepared, as strange things are afoot at the Circle K.</p>
<h2>What’s the Big Deal?</h2>
<p>It’s just meta-data (or data about data). As someone with some advanced
math training, let me tell you if they’re not actually listening to
conversations it really makes no difference. Suppose your phone records
contained the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your cell phone calls 911 from the intersection of First and Hickory
for 30 seconds, followed by a call to your wife for 20 seconds,
followed by a call to your insurance company for 4 minutes.</li>
<li>You receive a call from a medical lab, and then call an abortion
clinic, then call a pharmacy.</li>
<li>You call a cancer specialist, then your lawyer, then a suicide
hotline.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just meta-data? Hardly. It’s laughably absurd by collecting meta-data
your privacy hasn’t been invaded. It hasn’t been invaded, it’s been
destroyed. Eliminated. Vanished. Gone.</p>
<p>In fact, in some ways <a href="http://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2013/06/09/using-metadata-to-find-paul-revere/">I can learn <em>more</em> about you from meta-data</a>
than from actually listening in on phone calls.</p>
<h2>The Biblical Angle</h2>
<p>We’re not so interested in news, but what it means. Perhaps you didn’t
know how invasive meta-data collection is, but now you do. Where is all
this headed?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and
bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads.
And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had ﻿the mark, or the
name of the beast, or the number of his name. (Revelation 13)</p>
<p>When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of
by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let
him understand), then let them which be in Judaea flee into the
mountains. (Matthew 24)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These passages made no sense until the last few decades. When the
government has the processing power and storage to keep records on
<em>every</em> phone call, you understand it’s not far-fetched to see one man
completely control commerce. Tyrants <em>always</em> want control, and with the
amount of data and processing power now available, it’s not hard to see
it coming soon.</p>
<p>Everyone seeing what happens in the temple was an absurd idea until the
advent of satellite communications; now we see events world-wide in
real-time.</p>
<p>You hold more processing power in your smart-phone than used to go to
the moon (remember <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slide_rule">slide-rules</a>?). Is it really
hard to believe it is now possible to archive all the communication in
the <del>country</del> <ins>world</ins>?</p>
<p>History tells us we learn nothing from history. If this data is being
collected, it’s not a matter of <em>if</em> it will be used for evil purposes,
it’s a matter of <em>when</em>. Power corrupts, and the more power is vested,
the more likely it will be abused.</p>
<h2>Action Plan</h2>
<p>What can you do? Everyone is different; some aren’t bothered by
government snooping (They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a
little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety according to
Ben Franklin), others head to the hills to build fortified bunkers.</p>
<p>What works for you and your family may (or may not) work for me and my
family.</p>
<p>However, a few things are simple and we can all agree on.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/09/5-bible-commentators-you-should-be-listening.html">Learn your Bible</a>.
You’ll likely find a time you need knowledge but nobody is around
(<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/10/its-time-change.html">3AM phone call</a>
anyone?). Remember, you’re told to be prepared to give to every man
an answer.</li>
<li>Understand <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/11/post-modern-philosophy-church.html">post-modern philosophy</a>
and how it relates to the church as some use it in their <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/10/tactics-rebellion.html">rebellion against
God</a>.</li>
<li>Learn some basic survival skills. Not tin-foil hat gold, guns, guts,
and God, but common sense. Could you go for 3 days in your house
without power? Do you have food? Water? Ability to cook?</li>
<li>If you’ve ever thought of being involved in political issues, now is
the time. Learn for yourself, find out what’s really going on, and
get involved.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice in Matthew 24 after the warning regarding the abomination of
desolation the phrase “whosoever reads, let him understand” is inserted.
Have you read it? Then that applies to you. Do your homework and
understand what the Bible says, because the times it speaks about draws
near.</p>
<p>Are you really prepared for the 3AM phone call? If not, it’s time to dig
in and get started. If you’re not on our email newsletter, sign up and
ask questions.</p>
<p>Our focus will always be equipping people with Biblical literacy. We’re
devoted to preparing you for the 3AM phone call, in a Biblical sense,
and connecting the news dots.</p>
<p>Learn for yourself, do your own homework, and don’t believe anything
anyone tells you until you check it out for yourself.</p>
<p>It’s time to put your big-boy pants on. We’ll do what we can to help,
but ultimately it’s your choice.</p>
<p>Sadly, when we publish articles like this, we always lose a few
subscribers. So be it. Those who seek the truth, and desire to make a
difference with that truth will remain. We may not always agree, but we
share common goals — learn your Bible, and make an impact.</p>
<p>As John Loeffler says, <strong>your failure to be informed does not make me a
wacko</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you love wealth greater than liberty, the tranquility of servitude
greater than the animating contest for freedom, go home from us in
peace. We seek not your counsel, nor your arms. Crouch down and lick
the hand that feeds you; May your chains set lightly upon you, and may
posterity forget that you were our countrymen. — Samuel Adams</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>A Somber Ending</h2>
<p>Let me end on a quite serious note. Agencies claim it’s acceptable to
target citizens with drones, use the IRS to intimidate groups holding
various political and/or religious views, and compile vast amounts of
data on people. That’s not tin-foil hat paranoid delusions, it’s what
has <em>already been acknowledged as true</em>.</p>
<p>Couple those admissions with a history of persecution and a knowledge of
prophecy, it’s not a stretch to say you may one day find yourself on the
wrong side for proclaiming Christ and the truth.</p>
<p>Will you stand for the truth, or fold?</p>
<p>For the record, I am not suicidal, depressed, unhappy, cheating on my
wife, contemplating running away to another country, or anything of the
sort. In the event of my untimely demise, if anyone tells you otherwise,
it is a fabrication.</p>
<p>… because it’s 2:59 AM</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
