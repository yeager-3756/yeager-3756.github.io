<p>All the previous weapons have local impact, requiring you to be close to
the enemy. What if you want to assist in battles on the other side of
the globe? Fortunately Paul lists one more element — and many times it’s
the <em>last</em> one we reach for, when we have nothing but a prayer’s chance
left.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, being
watchful to this end with all perseverance and supplication for all
the saints.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prayer is the deciding factor and our opportunity to affect outcomes in
other countries. Satan will do anything to keep us from prayer. How
often do you begin to pray and immediately become distracted?</p>
<p>If you engage in war and your enemy possesses a weapon you knew would
turn the tide against you, wouldn’t you do whatever you could to keep
him from using it? Satan is no different.</p>
<p>Yet it’s important to understand what prayer is <em>not</em>. It’s <em>not</em>
getting your way. It’s <em>not</em> to get a Lexus. It’s <em>not</em> to get a pony.</p>
<p>God is not a genie granting wishes, and we should not treat Him that
way.</p>
<p>If my son asks for $100 to buy illegal pharmaceutical products —
because, after all, all the cool kids do it — should I say, sure, you’re
asking, so here it is?</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>Why then, do we treat God that way? We know when a child’s request
should <em>not</em> be answered. From the child’s view, it’s a valid request.
From someone who knows better, it’s not.</p>
<p>We share a similar relationship with God. Some things we ask for would
actually hurt if granted. Thus God says, no, that’s not good for you, so
no cookie — you’ve already had three.</p>
<p>Yes, you should make your requests known to God. Realize, however, <em>no</em>
is an answer.</p>
<p>Paul requested three times for his thorn in the flesh to be removed. The
answer came back, negative. For His reasons, Paul wasn’t healed of his
malady.</p>
<p>Just like a child to his parents, we pout and complain when God says no,
because we fail to understand the purpose of prayer.</p>
<p>Prayer isn’t about getting your way, it’s reporting for duty. It’s
aligning your thoughts and goals with His. And ultimately, it allows you
to engage in battle on the other side of the planet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication,
with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the
peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your
hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. (Philippians 4:6–7)</p>
</blockquote>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
