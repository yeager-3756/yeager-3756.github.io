<p>The Romans used two different shields, a small round one and the one
Paul mentions — 2 1/2 x 4 feet. It provides a movable defense, and
allows many men to advance on the enemy in formation, while being
protected. The integrity of the shield was critical — as with other
weapons, when you need it it’s too late to find out it doesn’t work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to
quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Warfare involved flaming arrows — usually dipped in tar and ignited. As
the arrow found its target, not only did it injure the person it hit,
but bits of flaming tar splatter and injure others around.</p>
<p>Satan shoots fiery arrows such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>God doesn’t love you anymore.</li>
<li>God isn’t hearing your prayers — you’re not doing it right.</li>
<li>You gone too far, you’ve lost your salvation.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s our shield of faith — faith that God says what He means and means
what He says — that extinguishes these fiery arrows of the enemy.</p>
<p>First, it’s the maneuverable part of the armor, and to some extent,
covers weaknesses in other areas. When things go <em>really</em> sideways, when
you’re stumbling backwards, when all else fails, you can take cover
behind the shield.</p>
<p>That means faith. <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2013/05/faith-isnt-what-you-think.html">Faith is not blind</a>
trust, it’s a reasonable expectation based on facts and experience.</p>
<p>Your faith in God’s Word must be solid. You may not understand
everything, but what God says, He means. The more you put that faith
into action, the stronger your shield becomes. It’s not based on <em>our</em>
understanding, it’s based on <em>His</em> promises. We must insure we
understand the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/series/the-nature-of-god.html">nature of God</a>, as that’s where faith begins.</p>
<p>Roman soldiers locked shields together to advance on enemy positions,
creating something akin to a tank, allowing advances on fortified
positions, <em>if soldiers work together</em>.</p>
<p>The Christian soldier must use the same tactic. Going it alone fails in
combat — both spiritual and worldly, which is why divide and conquer
remains a valuable military strategy. Spiritual enemies know this as
well, and want to pick you off by separating you from the remainder of
your unit.</p>
<p>Study <a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Neh&amp;c=4&amp;t=NKJV">Nehemiah 4</a>, and
notice in verse 18 Nehemiah had next to him someone who blows a trumpet.</p>
<p>Why? Whenever you hear the trumpet, everyone was to rally around. In
trouble? Having trials? Blow the stinking trumpet! Don’t try to go it
alone.</p>
<p>Never forget the Roman soldier’s lesson — you advance shoulder to
shoulder with your team.</p>
<p>It’s critical ideas learned on Sunday aren’t put in the back pocket for
the next six days. No, they work Monday as well. If you ignore your
combat gear six days of the week, you can’t be very effective.</p>
<p>Main ideas for the shield:</p>
<ul>
<li>What God says, He means.</li>
<li>Faith isn’t for Sunday only.</li>
<li>Soldiers advance together.</li>
</ul>
<p>Get those down, and you’re well on your way to having a superior shield.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
