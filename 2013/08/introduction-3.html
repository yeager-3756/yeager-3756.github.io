<p>As political correctness runs amok over society, some ideas have become
taboo — areas even Christians don’t venture to discuss much for fear of
“offending”; the new morality doesn’t bother with <em>truth</em>, but what is
non-offensive. While popular movies and TV shows involve vampires and
the occult, the one subject we aren’t allowed to speak of: spiritual
warfare. That’s only the realm of crazy people, right? We’ve grown
beyond thinking Satan exists, right?</p>
<p>Sadly, many in the church aren’t ready for combat, and if they do find
themselves in a “serious social occasion,” their encounter won’t end
well (read that: slaughtered like a pig) as they look down in their
toolbox and discover … nothing.</p>
<p>God provides complete weaponry, however, money, fame, fortune, and IQ
won’t help. Misunderstanding of reality causes people to make two
mistakes regarding spiritual warfare.</p>
<ol>
<li>Satan is behind every door.</li>
<li>Satan doesn’t exist.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first looks like the old Saturday Night Live “Church Lady” skits
with Dana Carvey. Remember the tag line? Sooner or later the Church Lady
says “could it be … SATAN?”. When you stub your toe, it’s Satan.</p>
<p>That’s a bit over the edge, and you can rest assured if you drink too
much and crash your car into a telephone pole, it’s your own stupidity —
not Satan — causing it.</p>
<p>The second error is just as bad, denying the truth and reality of Satan.</p>
<p>He exists. He’s real. He’s against you. He plots. He waits.</p>
<p>You need balance. Yes, Satan exists. Yes, he’s plotting against you. But
no, he’s not behind every door. Those not accepting the balanced truth
choose to live in <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/09/matrix-guide-christianity.html">The Matrix of deception</a>.</p>
<p>Don’t be one of those.</p>
<p>The classic list of God’s armor appears in Ephesians 6, as Paul has a
bit of free time to write while chained to a Roman soldier, as he finds
himself once again in prison.</p>
<p>Before you continue, you’ve got a choice to make. Do you want to be
comfortable in deception, or engage and make a difference?</p>
<p>Sure, that question is <em>easy</em> while sitting comfortably. But once the
fur begins to fly, it’s easy to forget, and desire to go back to
delusion. Becoming a
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2013/07/guardians-of-the-flock-sheepdogs.html">sheepdog</a>
isn’t a part-time job, not something you turn on and then off.</p>
<p>You either are — or are not — combat-ready.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ready are you? What know you of ready? … A Jedi must have the deepest
commitment, the most serious mind. – Yoda</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope you’re ready; let’s begin with Paul’s introduction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against
the wiles of the devil. (Ephesians 6:11)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul states why you need God’s armor — to make your stand, as in a
<em>military</em> stand. Yes, spiritual warfare is real. Yes, it’s a battle.
Yes, if you’re not prepared you’ll be a casualty.</p>
<p>However, even among those who understand reality, you’ll hear them when
things go sideways — Oh, I’m just so under attack right now.</p>
<p>That’s an excuse for a pathetic or non-existent response. Remember when
Jesus told Peter on this rock I will build my church, <em>and the gates of
Hell shall not prevail</em> against it?</p>
<p>What is a gate used for? It’s a <em>defensive</em> item. It’s designed to keep
the other offense out.</p>
<p>Are you on offense or defense? It’s time to switch, and understand <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2013/01/wile-e-coyotes-guide-to-offense.html">Wile E. Coyote’s guide to offense</a>.</p>
<p>In a word: <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/12/nuts.html">Nuts!</a>.</p>
<p>General Paul will detail your equipment, but in his introduction reminds
us we need the <em>whole</em> armor, and must depend on nothing else.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re missing a piece or two you won’t be very successful (read
that: you’ll be slaughtered like a pig).</li>
<li>If you’re untrained in its use you won’t prosper (read that: you’ll
be slaughtered like a pig).</li>
<li>If you’re counting on someone else to join the battle you’ll fail
(read that: you’ll be slaughtered like a pig).</li>
</ul>

<a href="https://framesofreferencellc.com/catalog/9780983111733/">get back in the game</a>.</p>
<p>… unless you want to be the pig.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
