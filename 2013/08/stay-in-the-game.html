  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>I recently returned from a Taekwondo tournament, and it’s always
fascinating to watch people react — especially parents toward their
kids. Of course, there’s always a know-it-all on the sidelines
critiquing each performance. For those bozos, I’m reminded of Theodore
Roosevelt’s words.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the
strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them
better …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I watched many competitors, some quite good, others, well, not so much.
However, each had the guts to try, and maybe succeed, maybe fail. The
know-it-all bozo on the sidelines doesn’t know that…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face
is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who
errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort
without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the
deeds …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sadly, the same thing happens in the church. I can’t tell you how many
times someone comes up to me (an elder of our church) with something
like “the Lord has placed this burden on me for xyz.”</p>
<p>Great, I say, go to it.</p>
<p>Then watch as the deer-in-the-headlights look comes on, and they say,
well, no, you know, ummm, well, I’m a bit busy, so I thought <em>you</em> could
do it, here’s what <em>you</em> need to do.</p>
<p>Garbage.</p>
<p>With few exceptions, if the Lord places an idea in your head, it’s for
<em>you</em> to do it. Be the man in the arena who dares great things, tries
again and again, perhaps comes short, but makes the effort.</p>
<p>Know this, critics will <em>always</em> be around. But they’re not in the
arena; ignore bozos who aren’t really interested in getting their hands
dirty.</p>
<p>Pastors, elders, and teachers exist to help you along, answer questions,
and offer support — <em>not</em> to do the job you’ve been called to do. You’re
the man in the arena who…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a
worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high
achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while
daring greatly …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Christian life differs not from Taekwondo. Two basic facts will always
exist.</p>
<ol>
<li>You’ll encounter bozos who are nothing but critics. Ignore them.</li>
<li>The difference between a black belt and a white belt is the black
belt never quit. Ever.</li>
</ol>
<p>As I wrote in my book “<a href="https://framesofreferencellc.com/catalog/9780983111733/">Get Back in the Game</a>”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For far too long I’ve seen Christians slaughtered like pigs from a
lack of preparedness when trouble arrives, and I’m tired of watching.
It’s time to <em>do</em> something about it. If you’re bringing
(metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve only set yourself up
as a pig going to the slaughter (put that image firmly in your mind,
because we’ll come back to it. A lot).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My goal is to make this site your go-to resource for filling your
toolbox so you’ll be ready for the 3AM phone call. Because neither I nor
your pastor can be everywhere and do everything — it’s time for each
person in the church to get in the game.</p>
<p>… because it’s 2:59 AM.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
