  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Misunderstanding God can have critical repercussions. Ideas like God
won’t send anyone to Hell because He loves everyone, God accepts
alternate lifestyles, and so on. Should a loving God accept any and all
sin because He loves you?</p>
<p>A typical complaint goes like this:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://sojo.net/blogs/2013/08/23/failing-take-bible-seriously">
<p>For example, how can we reconcile the loving person of Christ with the violent God of the Old Testament? How can God forgive the sins of the world yet kill a man for simply trying to stabilize the Ark of the Covenant (2 Sam. 6)? How can an unchanging God preach to us about loving our enemies yet facilitate the destruction of entire people groups — including children (Deut. 7:1–2; 20: 16–18)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three ideas exist in that thought, and they’re all wrong.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Split-Personality God</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>It’s really simple — the God of the Old Testament and God of the New
Testament are <strong>the same God</strong>. It’s not a mean, vengeful Old Testament
God, contrasted with a loving, peaceful New Testament one. God does not
change.</p>
<p>Does the author believe God is split-personality?</p>
<p>God <em>is</em> a god of love, but that does <em>not</em> mean winking at sin. Some
say the Old Testament shows the problem (sin), while the New Testament
shows the solution (Christ). It’s the same God in both.</p>
<p>Once again, <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/05/physics-and-the-bible-relativity.html">Relativity provides the solution</a>.
It’s the <em>same</em> God, viewed from two different perspectives.</p>
<p>Would the Jews say their God is a god of violence? Probably not. It’s
Christians who fail to understand justice, as many “Christians” ignore
real justice in pushing the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">false gospel of social justice</a>,
and failing to understand being <strong>a God of love (yet just) means sin
can’t be ignored</strong>.</p>
<p>In a rush to feel-good ideas about God, responsibility takes a back
seat.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Why A Feel-Good God Isn’t Really God</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>As already noted, a God of love, mercy, and justice, <em>must</em> have
penalties for sin.</p>
<p>If we are to have a just society, when someone commits murder we don’t
just ignore it — sure, go on your way, after all, we loooooove you and
we’re glad you found an alternative style which works for you.</p>
<p>No, <em>justice requires the penalty be paid</em>. Just as society must have
penalties for breaking the law, so must a just God have penalties for
breaking the LAW.</p>
<p>Forgiveness is not ignoring sin. Transgression still requires a penalty
be paid, it’s just you don’t have to pay it.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Love Isn’t What You Think</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>This is the same misunderstanding of the Old Testament versus the New.</p>
<p>The God of the Old Testament is still a God of love, while the God of
the New Testament is still just, requiring judgment for sin.</p>
<p>Love isn’t what’s seen on TV, specifically, <strong>love is a commitment, not
an emotion</strong>.</p>
<p>Times will exist when you don’t feel warm and fuzzy about your spouse.
But does that commitment change? Hopefully not. Love means nothing they
do or say can destroy that commitment.</p>
<p>Sure, it may not make you <em>feel</em> happy towards them, but the commitment
remains.</p>
<p><strong>Agapao is a verb</strong>, not a noun. It means commitment, not feelings.</p>
<p>God remains committed to you, but don’t mistake His commitment for
<em>approval</em> of sin. Love doesn’t mean approving everything — gee, I’m
glad you found heroin and that makes you happy.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you wouldn’t approve of a friend’s heroin use, so why should
God?</p>
<h2>Warning: Water Doesn’t Exist</h2>
<p>What happens with the Bible and God does <em>not</em> happen in other fields —
someone says something like I don’t understand how God <em>[insert problem
here]</em>, therefore it must not be true.</p>
<p>Nobody does that in any other subject. Nobody.</p>
<ul>
<li>I don’t understand how Oxygen and Hydrogen combine to form H<sub>2</sub>0,
therefore water must not exist.</li>
<li>I don’t understand how spin ½ particles obey Fermi-Dirac statistics,
thus it must not be true.</li>
<li>I don’t understand <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/01/frames-reference.html">Relativity</a>,
so it must not be true.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are obviously absurd, yet with the Bible, people say they don’t
understand how God does xyz, therefore it must not be true, or it’s a
mistake in the Bible (Note: the spin ½ came from “The Feynman Lectures
on Physics Volume I” , Feynman, Leighton, Sands page xii).</p>
<p>Tool Time Tip: He’s God, we’re not.</p>
<p>It’s quite a leap of hubris to say we (as finite beings) should
understand everything God does.</p>
<h2>The Great Education Hoax</h2>
<p>We’ve turned out a generation from government schools who can’t think
clearly, don’t understand logic, can barely read, and get their ideas
from reality TV.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder failure to understand the Bible (and the bizarre
theologies which follow) have infested the church. Failure to think
clearly leads to erroneous conclusions about God.</p>
<p>Modern heresies have their seeds in ideas which fail to follow logic and
proper analysis (or even consistency). To spot how absurd these ideas
really are becomes trivial with a basic background in logic. If you
haven’t done much study in logic, a good place to begin is Jason Lisle’s
“Discerning Truth” (ISBN 978-0890515945).</p>
<p>Sadly, thinking skills don’t seem to be taught much anymore, as the
trend moves toward fully buzzword-compliant terms, and <em>away</em> from
education.</p>
<ul>
<li>No child left behind</li>
<li>Race to the top</li>
<li>Goals 2000</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet <strong>we <em>know</em> what kind of education works</strong>, as Project Follow
Through began in 1967 concluded in 1995.</p>
<p>Cathy Watkins of Cal State Stanislaus says:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~adiep/ft/watkins.htm">
<p>Why have the results of the Follow Through evaluation failed to impact the policies and practices of the educational community? Why have the most effective approaches for educating children not been widely disseminated? Why has the knowledge gained from the Follow Through evaluation not been used to reform education in America?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All good questions.</p>
<p>If I was a cynical person I’d say when intelligent people <em>know</em> what
works in education, yet fail to follow it, their goals must <em>not</em> be
education.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/10/homeschooling-vs-public-education.html">Should you homeschool your kids?</a>
That’s a decision each family must decide for themselves, but if you
don’t at least <em>consider</em> and investigate it, you’re not considering all
good options for your children.</p>
<p><strong>No matter what education your child receives, be sure they obtain
instruction in logic</strong> and analysis — ideas sorely lacking in people
getting their ideas from TV.</p>
<p>But only if you want them to be free from heretical influences, remain
combat-ready, think for themselves, and stay in the game.</p>
<p>… Because it’s 2:59AM.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
