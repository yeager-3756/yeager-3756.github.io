<p>The first equipment piece required is the belt of truth; other armor
attaches to its foundation. We must never underestimate the belt’s
importance, and thus, truth.</p>
<p>We come to the strange phrase “gird your loins” we don’t hear much
today. When wearing loose fitting clothing, before performing any
strenuous activity you should tie your clothes around your waist to
avoid tripping — to gird your loins meant to be prepared for movement
and action.</p>
<p>If you’re to be ready for combat, preparation begins with truth.</p>
<p>What is truth? Philosophers struggled with this question for thousands
of years. Even Pilate asked, “What is truth?” (John 18:38).</p>
<p>It might shock you (or maybe not) to discover you’re being lied to
constantly (and we’re not just talking about the abs-zoom 2000). For
example, perhaps you heard about the famous Clinton budget surplus when
the government actually had money left over at the end of the year!</p>
<p>Only one problem — it’s 100% false.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/06/truth-lie-myth-surplus.html">myth of the surplus</a>
continues as both political parties are vested in continuing the
deception. Republicans say, see what happens when we control Congress?
Balanced budget! Democrats point to the president — Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Both political parties are lying. Each year during Clinton’s presidency
the country went <em>more</em> in debt — a fact easily provable by the US
Treasury’s “debt to the penny” web site (you know, the guys actually in
charge of the debt).</p>
<p><img id="image-debt-summary" src="/images/blog/201005-surplusmyth-debt-summary.png" alt="image-debt-summary" title="Debt Summary" width="625" height="377" class="centered border"></p>
<p>The red is <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/04/increasing-federal-deficit.html">what the debt</a>
actually <em>is</em>, the blue-green is what they <em>say</em> it is.</p>
<p>Yes, they’ve been lying to you all along. If you don’t believe me (and
you should do your own homework), read our article <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/06/truth-lie-myth-surplus.html">Myth of the Surplus</a>
and its companion articles on
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/tag/truth-lies.html">truth-lies</a> and discover the
truth for yourself.</p>
<p>As the world strains to find truth among piles of doggie poo-poo, for
the Christian it’s easy — God gives us truth in the Bible. We have the
complete revelation of truth in Jesus Christ, and the entire Bible
speaks of Him (John 5:39).</p>
<p>While we have a complete revelation of truth, remember truth is our most
precious asset. <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2013/06/truth-isnt-relative.html">Truth is not relative</a>,
truth is absolute.</p>
<p>Mishandling truth affects the church as well, as some popular (but very
wrong) ideas infect the church.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">The Gospel of Social Justice</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/06/red-letter-christianity-clueless-about-sin.html">Red Letter Christianity</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/06/liberal-theology-begins-with-denying-the-bible.html">Liberal Theology</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/01/shifting-sands-of-post-modern-philosophy.html">Post-Modern Thought</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As we head to the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/07/the-age-of-apostasy.html">age of apostasy</a>,
finding — and then guarding — truth becomes vital, and is <em>step one</em> in
becoming combat-ready.</p>
<p>The Christian soldier must remember that while he has truth, the world
in general does not. The world does not see truth as absolute. The theme
for today is “Don’t confuse me with facts, my mind is made up!”</p>
<p>Naturally, if you’re to become skilled in truth, you must train and
work, as General Paul told Timothy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to
be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. (2 Timothy 2:15)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rightly dividing in Greek is ὀρθοτομέω (orthotomeō), meaning straight,
precise, and sharp. It means take the Bible as it says, don’t
“modernize” or allegorize it. Those modernizing the Bible (social
justice, liberal theology, post-modernism, etc) are <em>not</em> rightly
dividing God’s Word.</p>
<p>Being combat-ready isn’t part-time entertainment, it’s a way of life.</p>
<p>Remember these points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Truth forms the primary combat foundation — all else is based on it.</li>
<li>Absolute truth exists. Values are <em>not</em> relative.</li>
<li>Jesus is truth (John 14:6), and does not change (Hebrews 13:8).</li>
<li>Truth doesn’t change either.</li>
<li>Truth is not a popularity contest.</li>
<li>Your failure to be informed does not make me a wacko. (John Loeffler)</li>
</ol>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
