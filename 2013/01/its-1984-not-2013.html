  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Orwell’s “1984” probably isn’t on too many High School reading lists
anymore, for the simple reason it’s too close to reality — a future
where “news” is edited to fit official narratives, massive government
surveillance exists, after-birth abortion, and if you recall “Logan’s
Run”, when your usefulness runs out, your life ends as well (at the
hands of the government).</p>
<p>Oops, <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/03/after-birth-abortion.html">after-birth abortion</a>
isn’t fictional, it’s actually been proposed. My bad.</p>
<p>During the discussion of national healthcare, Sarah Palin received
considerable flack when she noted national health care results in “Death
Panels” — some group somewhere deciding who will live, and who will die,
by controlling who receives what medical treatment.</p>
<p>Maybe you should take a pill, instead of having the operation.</p>
<p>The idea isn’t new, however.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can’t justify your existence, if you’re not pulling your weight
in the social boat, if you’re not producing as much as you consume or
perhaps a little more, then, clearly, we cannot use the organizations
of our society for the purpose of keeping you alive, because your life
does not benefit us … (George Bernard Shaw)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much of the discussion over death panels was theoretical — or was it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Up to 60,000 patients die on the Liverpool Care Pathway each year
without giving their consent, shocking figures revealed yesterday.</p>
<p>A third of families are also kept in the dark when doctors withdraw
lifesaving treatment from loved ones.</p>
<p>Despite the revelations, Jeremy Hunt last night claimed the pathway
was a “fantastic step forward.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those in charge of nationalized healthcare <em>love</em> panels which “contain
costs,” by (surprise!) rationing care, or actively terminating a
person’s life (an after-birth abortion), because the issue will always
be <em>power</em>, not healthcare (and of course, elites never worry about it,
because rules are for little people).</p>
<p>Remember, what you see in England is 10–20 years away from the United
States, as they’re a bit further down the road. What does the future
look like? Again, back to England:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An elderly woman died alone after doctors failed to tell relatives
they were ending her life on the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway.</p>
<p>Olive Goom, 85, passed away with no one by her side after medics
neglected to consult with her family about her treatment at Chelsea
and Westminster Hospital.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All the discussion about death panels, doctors killing patients instead
of treating them, and governments containing costs by rationing care
miss the critical issue — <strong>it’s not <em>quality</em> of life, it’s <em>sanctity</em>
of life</strong>. Those two positions represent completely different
worldviews.</p>
<p>The first, God doesn’t exist, and the government should control
everyone’s life, putting government in the place of God.</p>
<p>The other, God created life, and it’s not our job to play God.</p>
<p>Sadly many “Christians” fall for the lie of God-as-government. Don’t
believe me? Check out the deceptive <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">false gospel of social justice</a>,
as some groups proclaim government’s job is to “help” God out, as if God
is weak or something.</p>
<p>As secular humanism becomes the official state religion, we’ll continue
to travel down this path as one side sees sanctity of life, the other
quality, and when that quality diminishes, life can be terminated—even
against the patient’s wishes—to serve the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/05/church-common-good.html">common good</a>.</p>
<p>Yet God created it, and you have no right to tell God move over, you’re
in the command seat now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of
Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted
among Men …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God created life, and nobody should try to kick God off His throne.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
