<p>As we enter the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/07/the-age-of-apostasy.html">age of apostasy</a>
it’s becoming fashionable to <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2013/03/redefining-the-bible-to-political-ideology.html">re-define Biblical doctrine</a>
to align with radical political ideology or <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/06/red-letter-christianity-clueless-about-sin.html">change terms like sin</a>
to something “softer”; heretics abandon God’s Word for the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/06/the-cult-of-liberal-theology.html">cult of liberal theology</a>
in their <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/10/tactics-rebellion.html">rebellion against God</a>.</p>
<p>Many heretical ideas originate from <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/11/post-modern-philosophy-church.html">post-modern theology</a>
and those <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/09/matrix-guide-christianity.html">living in the Matrix</a>,
replacing the rock-solid of God’s Word with the shifting sand of … well
… nothing.</p>
<p>This week’s attempt to change clear and obvious Biblical teaching:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://sojo.net/blogs/2013/04/04/political-subversion-cross">
<p>What we now call the “substitutionary atonement theory” has understood the cross primarily as the beginning of salvation, and not also as the culmination of a radical life lived within an Empire. … We can, however, see the cross in a different interpretative light with regard to the story of Jesus. The cross, rather than being understood as <em>the</em> reason of Jesus’ incarnation, can rather be understood as the culmination of the subversive way he lived as well as the subversive lessons he taught. (italics in original)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, you <em>can</em> change that, but that doesn’t make it <em>correct</em>.</p>
<p>Trying to cram political ideology onto the Bible just doesn’t work … no
matter how much verbal twister you play.</p>
<p>In allusions concerning Jesus in the Old Testament, is there <em>one</em> which
puts the cross in a subversive and radical political light? Or are they
illustrated as a substitute atonement for us?</p>
<p>The defining question: What is the gospel? Is it <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">social justice?</a>
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/05/church-common-good.html">Common good</a>? Or
is it what Paul taught?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye
have received, and wherein ye stand … that Christ died for our sins
according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose
again the third day according to the scriptures. (1 Corinthians 15)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>… and what Paul warned against replacing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called
you to live in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different
gospel — which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are
throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of
Christ. But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel
other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God’s curse!
(Galatians 1:6–8 NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cross <em>is</em> <strong>the</strong> reason for Jesus’ coming to earth. It <em>is</em> what
provides salvation.</p>
<p>Paul called viewing the cross in a different interpretative light a
perversion.</p>
<p>Yes, as the author says, we <em>can</em> see the cross under any number of
alternative views. But those are not Biblical, and the re-definition was
specifically warned against by Paul in the strongest language you could
put on paper.</p>
<p>The cross came because of sin, not subversive and radical political
ideology. Period.</p>
<p>If being subversive is what the cross is about, Paul was wrong, thus the
Bible is wrong, and in error.</p>
<p>Who wants to agree with that?</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
