  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>We normally don’t discuss politics for politics sake. However, when the
majority of people—of <em>all</em> political stripes—are hugely unhappy with
Washington, it’s time to peel back the curtain and reveal <em>why</em>
Washington is so broken, and why it fails to solve anything, only making
situations worse. How did we get to the point when government is
dysfunctional?</p>
<p>Reading the far-left’s comments about the retirement of Max Baucus
(D-Montana) has been interesting. The anger spewed towards him <em>from the
left</em> has been fascinating.</p>
<h2>1. In the Beginning There Was … Gerrymandering</h2>
<p>… And the “D’s” and “R’s” saw that it was good.</p>
<p><a href="http://pjmedia.com/zombie/2010/11/10/gerrymandering-101/?singlepage=true">Gerrymandering</a>
involves creating election districts favoring one party over the other.</p>
<p>The object is to <em>pack</em> your opponents party into a few massively
favorable districts (like 75/25 or more), and give <em>your</em> party many
more districts with favorable—but smaller—ratios (like 60/40). The
resulting districts look like strange creatures; for example, Illinois
District 4:</p>
<img class="centered border" width="377" height="298" src="/images/blog/Illinois_District_4_2004.png">
<p>As taught in political-science class: the fair apportioning of voters is
called “districting,” while unfair is called “Gerrymandering.”
Naturally, the favorable party thinks it’s fair, while the other cries
foul.</p>
<p>Two things happen via this strategy:</p>
<ol>
<li>The party doing the Gerrymandering wins more districts.</li>
<li><em>Each</em> Gerrymandered district is “safe” for one party or the other.</li>
</ol>
<p>The political parties have become so good at this strategy, it leads to
the next problem.</p>
<h2>2. Moderates Don’t Exist Anymore</h2>
<p>As Gerrymandering becomes more entrenched, it leads to more extreme
political candidates. <strong>In most districts, the winner of the primary of
the Gerrymandered party wins the general</strong>. For a “D” district, whoever
wins the primary wins the general, and the same for a safe “R” district.</p>
<p>Two things thus occur:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you don’t get to vote in the primary, your vote won’t matter.</li>
<li>It encourages extreme political views, and discourages compromise.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first because if you’re a “D” voting in an “R” district, you don’t
get to vote in the primary for the “R” candidates, but since it’s a safe
district, the winning <em>party</em> is already known. <strong>Whoever wins the
primary wins the general</strong>.</p>
<p>This also affects national elections: If you’re a voter in California,
Texas, or New York, those outcomes are already decided — the parties
could run Mickey Mouse versus Einstein and the mouse would win (some
would say the parties have <em>already</em> run Mickey Mouse and he won, but we
digress).</p>
<p>Nancy Pelosi in San Francisco has <em>nothing</em> to fear from moderate
candidates (or candidates of the other party), as her district has been
programmed to elect radical Democrats. In fact, Pelosi <em>benefits</em> the
more extreme positions she takes, as her only realistic challenge would
come in a primary from someone more extreme than she (i.e. farther
left).</p>
<p>The result? Compromise and civilized discourse tossed out the window.</p>
<h2>3. You Vote for Party Leaders, not Candidates</h2>
<p>It does not matter what <em>your</em> Congress critter says their positions are
during election season. It only matters what their leadership says. In
other words, <strong>if you vote for a “D”, you’re really voting for
Pelosi/Reid, and if you vote for an “R”, you’re really voting for
McConnell/Boehner</strong>.</p>
<p>What <em>your</em> Congress critter says is 100 percent irrelevant. If you vote “D”,
listen to Pelosi — that’s what you’re voting for (and similarly on the
other side).</p>
<p>This has played out on everything from the Patriot act to Obamacare as
the last few years has seen the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFroMQlKiag">normal process for a bill</a> subverted. Now, the
new norm is back-room deals cut by the leadership, with few
rank-and-file members having any input at all until the bill is thrown
onto the floor for a vote. As one Senator said in 2007:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is not how the process is supposed to work. We should not be asked to trust our colleagues and vote to put a bill on the floor when we do not know that the bill text is even finalized, that the bill has not been drafted by legislative counsel, the bill has not been introduced or even given a bill number, the committee process was skipped and not followed …
<cite><a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2007-05-21/pdf/CREC-2007-05-21-pt1-PgS6362-2.pdf#page=4">Congressional Record, May 21, 2007</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It happened with the Patriot act, Obamacare, and others. When those
bills got to the floor, votes were rushed with no time to actually
examine and read the bills; members of Congress are arm-twisted into
voting whatever the party leadership says.</p>
<p>Only later does the public discover what a stinking, festering, pile of
doggy doo-doo the bill actually was (is).</p>
<h2>4. Bribery / Ethics-challenged</h2>
<p>During the recent Democrat party attempt at gun-control, the truth came
out:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=BE6604EC-661E-4BF3-B857-2462B398816B">
<p>“Bribery isn’t what it once was,” said an official with one of the major gun-control groups. “The government has no money. Once upon a time you would throw somebody a post office or a research facility in times like this. Frankly, there’s not a lot of leverage.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember, it’s not how much you get that determines whether it’s ethical
or not, but <em>considering the offer</em>. When people defend they got $300
Million for their pet group, we’re supposed to be relieved by the
<em>amount</em> they sold their soul for, instead of 30 pieces of silver?</p>
<p>The end result remains the same as Judas: they sold their soul. Perhaps
those bribed Congressmen should read Psalm 15.</p>
<h2>5. Politicians Despise the Voters</h2>
<p>The fallout over the sequester you may or may not agree with. However,
one thing every sane person will agree with — when the administration
says to <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/06/leaked-email-adds-fuel-to-claims-white-house-playing-politics-over-impact-cuts/">make the cuts painful</a>,
that’s a sign Washington simply does not care about citizens.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, there <em>are</em> no budget cuts — only <em>reductions to requested
increases</em>. In the alternate universe of politics, if a budget was $100
Million, and next year they ask for $150 Million, but receive $120
Million, they consider that a “cut” of $30 Million, <em>not an increase of
20%</em>.</p>
<p>Be assured, the government will spend <em>more</em> this year than last as each
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/08/debt-deal-disaster.html">debt deal leads to disaster</a>;
budget cuts are second only to the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/06/truth-lie-myth-surplus.html">myth of the surplus</a>
in false ideas claimed as true.</p>
<p>Some people choose to believe the lie, others do their homework and
discover the deception.</p>
<p>Voters exist only to be manipulated to voting to return those in power
yet again. The aptly named “LIV” or Low Information Voter believes
whatever garbage is tossed their way (like budget cuts actually exist,
the so-called Clinton surplus existed, Social Security is funded, and so
on). Of course, the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/01/failure-public-education.html">failure of public education</a>
creates people who can’t think logically as schools use whatever trendy
technique exists, rather than what works — <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/10/homeschooling-vs-public-education.html">my child is not a social experiment</a>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There you have it, 5 reasons why Washington remains broken.</p>
<ol>
<li>Gerrymandering</li>
<li>Loss of moderates</li>
<li>Only party leaders count</li>
<li>Poor ethics</li>
<li>Washington Monument Strategy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Want to fix it? Good luck. As the country turns away more and more from
ethics and morals — even for people in the highest elected offices —
it’s no surprise those values permeate society. A return to
old-fashioned God-given morals and people holding leaders accountable
for their lies will always be step one in turning the country away from
corruption.</p>
<p>Only then can we return to a government of the people, by the people,
and <em>for</em> the people.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
