  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>When your 3AM call finally arrives (and one day it will), will you be
prepared to handle it? We frequently discuss various bad ideas blowing
through the church, but what if you’re suddenly all alone — will you be
able to determine heresy from reality?</p>
<p>It comes down to one word: motivation.</p>
<p>Lou Holtz is one of my favorite commentators; his special segments on
ESPN are priceless. If you’ve caught him on a political program
discussing current events, you can only come to one conclusion: Lou
Holtz for President.</p>
<p>Lou has a masterful way of getting the most out of his players. Let’s
apply Lou’s method to Christianity.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ability</strong> is what you’re capable of doing.</li>
<li><strong>Motivation</strong> determines what you do.</li>
<li><strong>Attitude</strong> determines how well you do it. (Lou Holtz)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2>Ability</h2>
<p>In sports, some have more ability than others. In the church, <em>everyone</em>
has the basic ability to perform their own studies. Can you read? Do you
have common sense? Then you’re qualified.</p>
<p>Sure, learning Greek, logic, textual analysis, and critical thinking at
times will help, but make no excuses — <em>everyone</em> in the church has the
ability to do their own homework.</p>
<p>God didn’t lock His truths away so only a learned few could understand.</p>
<p>99.5% of people in church have the basic skills needed. No excuses.
You’re <em>capable</em> of in-depth study, so Lou moves on to the next step:
motivation.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Motivation determines what you do. You could have the ability to run a
sub-10 second 100 meter dash, but if you don’t put down the bon-bons and
get off the couch, you’ll never accomplish what your ability allows you
to do.</p>
<p>That’s a big problem in the church: slothfulness.</p>
<p>It’s easy to say, hey, the pastor will be around to answer questions and
figure out the tough stuff.</p>
<p>That’s not a sure thing. What will you do when nobody is around? It’s a
sad commentary on our society watching everyone look for a bailout — as
long as someone else pays, I want free stuff!</p>
<p>The same attitude infests the church. It’s time to get off the couch,
and <a href="https://framesofreferencellc.com/catalog/9780983111733/">get in the game</a>.</p>
<h2>Attitude</h2>
<p>Attitude is tough. Ability and motivation only take you so far. What if
a soldier has a bad attitude? Will their training be effective?</p>
<p>When the bad-attitude soldier enters combat, they’ll be easy prey for
the enemy.</p>
<p>Of course, the same idea applies to <em>you</em>. Once motivated to get
involved, it’s time to have the correct attitude — never quit, never
give in, never surrender.</p>
<p>Dare to get in the game. If you need help, ask questions.</p>
<p>What’s holding you back … right now? More importantly, what can we do to
help you through it? Email, comment, ask.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How you respond to the challenge in the second half will determine
what you become after the game, whether you are a winner or a loser.
(Lou Holtz)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>… because it’s 2:59AM.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the
strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them
better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,
whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives
valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is
no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive
to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who
spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the
triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at
least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be
with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.
(Theodore Roosevelt “The Man in The Arena”)</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
