  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Early in life, a child has driven in their brain calling 911 in an
emergency. When you’re in trouble, or a medical crisis, call 911 and
help is on the way. But, as it turns out, is that <em>really</em> the best
idea?</p>
<p>A Wisconsin sheriff made headlines when he created a commercial with the
following:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.examiner.com/article/wisconsin-sheriff-tells-his-people-get-a-gun-for-your-own-protection">
<p>“I’m Sheriff David Clarke, and I want to talk to you about something personal…your safety.</p>
<p>It’s no longer a spectator sport; <b>I need you in the game, but are you ready?</b> With officers laid-off and furloughed, simply <b>calling 9-1-1 and waiting is no longer your best option</b>.</p>
<p>You can beg for mercy from a violent criminal, hide under the bed, or you can fight back; but <b>are you prepared</b>? Consider taking a certified safety course in handling a firearm so you can defend yourself until we get there. <b>You have a duty to protect yourself and your family</b>. We’re partners now. Can I count on you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sheriff tells you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Safety is not a spectator sport.</li>
<li>You must be in the game.</li>
<li>Calling 911 may (or may not) work.</li>
<li>You can hide or fight back.</li>
<li>It’s your duty.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/page/newsletter.html">Regular readers</a> might wonder —
did I write that copy? Nope, though it sounds like what you’ve read
repeatedly on this site, but in physical, not spiritual, terms.</p>
<p>When things go bump in the night, when <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/series/its-259am.html">it’s 3AM</a>, when nobody is around,
do you look to the church’s version of the 911 call — your pastor? Too
many Christians fail when it really counts; we can tell by the bodies
strewn about the frozen tundra (we call them causalities).</p>
<p>As Zig Ziglar says, do you respond or react?</p>
<p>Suppose you go to the doctor, and for a condition he prescribes
medicine. Naturally, he’ll schedule a follow-up visit to see how you’re
doing.</p>
<p>Then he looks at the chart, and says your body is responding to the
medicine. Sounds good, right? But maybe he looks at the results and says
you’re <em>reacting</em> to the treatment. Quite a different image.</p>
<p>When it’s 3AM, do you <em>respond</em>, or <em>react</em>? The well-trained and
equipped soldier of God <em>responds</em>, while the pew-warmer <em>reacts</em>
(panics).</p>
<p>Which group do you want to be in?</p>
<p>It matters not if we’re discussing personal defense or your Christian
life. Looking for someone to bail you out of a tough spot was <em>never</em> a
realistic option. You can fold, or <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/12/nuts.html">fight back</a>. Either way, it’s
something <em>you</em> must do, not wait for someone else. It’s time to <a href="https://framesofreferencellc.com/catalog/9780983111733/">get in the game</a>.</p>
<p>Your life, your choice.</p>
<p>No matter your choice, <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/09/matrix-guide-christianity.html">reality doesn’t change</a>
just because you don’t like it; never forget John Loeffler’s words “your
failure to be informed does not make me a wacko.”</p>
<p>… because the clock <em>still</em> reads 2:59AM.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
