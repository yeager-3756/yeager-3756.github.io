  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Saul Alinsky in “Rules for Radicals” laid out a framework for community
organizing, or those who want to “stick it to the man.” Several
prominent politicians are intimately familiar (or even taught) the
Alinsky method. It’s also used by radical groups — some even claiming to
be Christian. As these tactics become more prevalent, it’s vital to
understand Alinsky methods, in particular rule 13.</p>
<h2>Alinsky’s Rule</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The current debate over gun control is being waged via Alinsky methods.
Simply put, Alinsky methods identify a group (NRA, and by extension,
lawful gun owners), then freeze it. In other words don’t allow the group
to define or defend itself. Whatever the community organizer says,
that’s the message.</p>
<p>Personalize it to give it a face. In this case gun owners have the face
of Wayne LaPierre.</p>
<p>Then polarize it. Call them unreasonable. Extreme. Unlawful. Immoral.
Hating kids. And of course, Nazi. Anything to create an evil image in
the eyes of anyone listening.</p>
<p>That’s the Alinsky method.</p>
<p>The big problem with the Alinsky method comes from what it lacks:
reason, logic, and critical thinking; in place of rational thought
you’ll find group-think and slogans.</p>
<p>No matter what they say, community organizers using Alinsky methods are
<em>never</em> interested in actual dialog, as the desired outcome has been
pre-determined. They want “X”, so how can we demonize those not in favor
of “X” to win?</p>
<h2>The Church and Alinsky’s Rule</h2>
<p>Alinsky dedicated his book to Satan, so you have to wonder why
“Christians” use tactics of the devil.</p>
<p>Sadly, lack of critical thinking infests the church in bizarre ideas
like <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">social justice</a>;
an idea so absurd, so laughable, so heretical, it’s <em>stunning</em> so many
intelligent people fall for the deception.</p>
<p>Social justice is an illusion otherwise intelligent people fall for
because they’re focused on what the magician <em>wants</em> you to see, while
the other hand slips poison in your drink. Remember who Alinsky
dedicated his book to?</p>
<p>Why do they fall for it? <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/06/didactic-dialectic-thought.html">Dialectic group-think</a>.
Even in the church, many fail to understand basic logic, and rarely read
their Bible, instead choosing to follow the herd, tumbling right off the
cliff to the rocks below.</p>
<p>Those who fail in basic preparedness are <em>guaranteed</em> to be deceived and
fail.</p>
<h2>Other Uses for Alinsky Tactics</h2>
<p>Persecution frequently uses Alinsky methods — whether that persecution
is legal or illegal. It’s how the Nazis went after the Jews. Pick a
target. Freeze it. Personalize it. Polarize it.</p>
<p>In the case of government persecution this can all be <em>legal</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a group (Jews, gun owners, “rich,” etc)</li>
<li>Marginalize them.</li>
<li>Blame them for problems (economy, shootings, etc).</li>
<li>Create laws restricting that group.</li>
<li>Enforce the law.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s how persecution works, and it’s used against groups others see as
“undesirable.”</p>
<p>These methods <em>must</em> be understood, and it’s why rights denied a group
are rights denied all. You can’t have free speech while outlawing
so-called hate speech. To make the attempt violates the law of
consistency.</p>
<p>Get a copy of “Rules for Radicals” by Saul Alinsky, and you’ll quickly
discover just how much his method has permeated politics, lobbying, and
sadly, even the church.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
