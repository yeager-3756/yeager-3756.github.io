  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Genesis 14 contains a rather obscure passage on Melchizedek — someone we
wouldn’t even know if it weren’t for Paul’s reference in Hebrews.
Unfortunately, this focus on Melchizedek means we miss other important
lessons from that chapter.</p>
<p>The setup is simple: Abram’s family becomes involved in a battle between
kings, and Abram’s nephew Lot becomes a prisoner during the battle. The
lesson comes from Abram and his response.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Abram heard that his nephew Lot had been captured, he mobilized
the 318 trained men who had been born into his household. Then he
pursued Kedorlaomer’s army until he caught up with them at Dan. There
he divided his men and attacked during the night. Kedorlaomer’s army
fled, but Abram chased them as far as Hobah, north of Damascus. Abram
recovered all the goods that had been taken, and he brought back his
nephew Lot with his possessions and all the women and other captives.
(Genesis 14 NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>1. Get in the Game!</h2>
<p>Notice Abram does <em>not</em> pout, cry, or look for someone to bail him out.
Today it’s popular to blame everyone else, or wait for government or
someone else to swoop in and (maybe) save the day. Whether it’s your own
personal defense or the defense of your family, it’s not something to
leave to someone else.</p>
<p>Step one: <a href="https://framesofreferencellc.com/catalog/9780983111733/">get in the game</a>. Abram
<em>mobilized</em> because he was prepared to be <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/11/next-man-up.html">next man in</a>.</p>
<h2>2. Be Prepared</h2>
<p>If you’ve accomplished step one, congratulations, you’re way ahead of
90% or so of the population who sits around waiting for someone else to
do <em>their</em> job.</p>
<p>You may have the desire to get in the game, but lacking preparations,
you’ll be slaughtered like a pig. Sorry, that’s the way it is: combat
has a winner and loser; the winner gets to live, and the loser … well …
sometimes not so much.</p>
<p>Step two: get ready. This means Bible study, mental toughness, and a
never-quit, never-surrender attitude.</p>
<h2>3. Keep your Stuff, the Enemy Wants The Souls</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give back my people who were
captured. But you may keep for yourself all the goods you have
recovered.” (Genesis 14 NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Want an easy life? Trade stuff for souls. Since the enemy wants the
souls, he’ll gladly give you stuff in exchange. It’s the disease of
lacking boldness to do the right thing, preferring the easy life
instead. Unfortunately this disease runs through the church, as Walter
Martin explains.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re suffering from an endemic disease. This disease in the Christian
world is known by its Latin name, non-rock-a-boatus. What it really
means is, “Whatever you do, don’t rock the boat.” The cure for this
disease is a baptism of boldness.</p>
<p>… You may be thinking, “You seem pretty uptight about this, Dr.
Martin.” And I am, because we need to get rid of this
non-rock-a-boatus mentality that is so prevalent in this country. …</p>
<p>Do you know there are Christians running around today waiting for a
convenient moment to “preach the word” that never comes? And the
reason it never comes is because <strong>God doesn’t care about convenience;
God cares about obedience</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Non-rock-a-boatus Must Stop</h2>
<p>Abram had knowledge of battle tactics, and thus able to deploy his
resources against the enemy in the most advantageous way. You won’t
obtain that knowledge sitting around eating Bon-Bons. It’s work.</p>
<p>Get in the game. Be prepared. Rock the boat.</p>
<p>… because it’s 2:59 AM</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
