  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>A friend of mine posted an article <a href="http://julienevue.blogspot.com/2013/11/go-and-do-same.html">Go and do the same</a>
regarding how we assist others in the church going through tough times.
She’s polite and tactful in her article; I’m more direct and aren’t
interested in ruffling feathers so I can say what she danced around: the
church has ADD (attention deficit disorder).</p>
<p>Before we get to ADD, the first problem comes from people failing to ask
for help. I frequently notice this when asking someone how they’re
doing, and they say fine. I <em>know</em> they’re lying through their teeth, a
syndrome dubbed “Tony the Tiger Christians.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t become a Tony the Tiger Christian, where everything is
grrrrreat! The church should be a friendly place where people can
assist one another through life’s trials. If you’re not availing
yourself of the assistance, you’re not functioning as the church
should. Blow the trumpet as Nehemiah did — let’s not play church and
be Tony the Tiger Christians. (“Get Back in the Game”, 2012, ISBN
978-0-9831117-3-3, page 84)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Blow the Trumpet!</h2>
<p>In Nehemiah as he worked building the wall he had a guy with a trumpet
next to him. If the battle became too fierce, he blew the trumpet and
allowed other troops to rally around. That’s the Biblical example.</p>
<p>Don’t be Tony the Tiger — BLOW THE STINKING TRUMPET.</p>
<p>That’s step one. If you’re not asking for help, that’s not good. Satan’s
strategy uses divide and conquer. Don’t be a loner, use the pattern from
Nehemiah and blow the trumpet and allow people to rally around.</p>
<p>So many are going through so much these days, if your fellowship has a
prayer chain it can be a bit overwhelming at times, simply due to the
volume.</p>
<p>Bad news folks, it’s likely to get <em>worse</em>.</p>
<h2>Attention Deficit Disorder</h2>
<p>That leads to the church and ADD. We’re generally good about providing
assistance. I don’t know about other fellowships, but if I made one
phone call, within 15 minutes I’d have 20 people at my door — people who
dropped whatever they were doing to respond.</p>
<p>We’re <em>really</em> good at responding. When the manure hits the rotating air
mover, we’ve had more food delivered than we can eat (and it’s
exceptionally good food, but I digress).</p>
<p>Then the problem. So much happens to so many, in a week or so the crowd
moves on to the next crisis, and leaves behind those who still might
need help and support.</p>
<p>I’m not condemning anyone, but I’ve been in on those situations, and
while the outpouring of support in such a short period can truly lift
spirits, the moving on of the crowd to the next crisis occurs just as
fast.</p>
<p>I’ve made that mistake — a lot.</p>
<p>Since then, I work hard to not forget, and check in with people even
weeks later. It’s important to not forget and assume simply because it’s
no longer a crisis, those needs no longer exist.</p>
<h2>My Dog Illustrates The Lesson</h2>
<p>My dog isn’t doing very well. At 16, he’s well into senior years, and we
may soon face <em>that</em> decision (shudder). My dog and I have a special
relationship due to his illness 6 weeks after he was born — I stayed up
with him at night, and cleaned up his little puppy barf.</p>
<p>We bonded <em>fast</em>.</p>
<p>So now, 16 years later near the end of his life, it’s rough for me to
watch. I talk about it a lot, and perhaps many people become weary of listening.</p>
<p>This week, a friend messaged me and asked about the dog.</p>
<p>No prompting, she didn’t wait to see me, she took the initiative because
as an animal lover, she <em>knew</em> the situation, thought about it for some
reason, and made the effort to ask.</p>
<p>It means a lot, simply because it wasn’t one of those “church moments”
on Sunday — you know, you see someone hobbling in on crutches and
remember to ask, oh yeah, how’s your surgery recovery going?</p>
<p>Never forget. Make the effort. Move away from ADD.</p>
<p>I’ve messed this up before and forgotten about people. I’ll likely do it
again. But I’m trying to throw off the ADD mentality and focus on what
people really need — sometimes even when they’re in Tony the Tiger mode
and won’t blow the trumpet.</p>
<h2>Fight Fight Fight!</h2>
<p>My <a href="https://framesofreferencellc.com/catalog/9780983111740/">book on Hebrews</a> contains a story you
probably won’t believe. I could put it in a documentary and people would
say, no, that didn’t really happen — I know I wouldn’t believe it if I
didn’t know the people involved.</p>
<p>Life is hard. You may not get a Lexus, an ice cream, or a pony.</p>
<p>By the way, stubbornness isn’t always bad. It’s required to <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/fight-for-your-ideas/">fight for your ideas</a>.</p>
<p>You’ve got to fight, and pick up the mantle for those wearied by the
struggle. It takes dedication and commitment, and an absolute refusal to
bow to the siren’s call of ADD.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You ask, what is our policy? I will say: It is to wage war, by sea,
land and air, with all our might and with all the strength that God
can give us; to wage war against a monstrous tyranny, never surpassed
in the dark and lamentable catalogue of human crime. That is our
policy. You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word: victory.
Victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory, however
long and hard the road may be; for without victory, there is no
survival. (Winston Churchill “Blood, Toil, Tears”, House of Commons, May 13, 1940)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To restate what Churchill said in another speech, let us fight and
continue with our duties, so even if the Lord tarries for a thousand
years, people will still say this was the church’s finest hour.</p>
<p>Stay in the game. Never quit. Never give in. Never surrender. Never
forget. Blow the trumpet.</p>
<p>… because it’s 2:59AM.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
