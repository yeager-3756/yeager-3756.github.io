  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Headlines in the last few months reveal an administration failing to
tell the truth, spies on citizens, and believes using drones to kill
American citizens is acceptable. Not to mention <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/11/buzzword-alert-quantitative-easing.html">quantitative easing</a>,
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2013/11/health-ad-campaign-this-cant-be-real.html">promoting debauchery</a>,
and more. As our country continues to slouch toward Gomorrah, many
wonder how the ship can be turned around. How can we possibly get enough
people to return to correct values?</p>
<p>It turns out much can be accomplished by a few, if those few have deep
convictions. When the Jews finally were able to return to the land after
captivity, only about 3% accepted the offer. Living in bondage provided
security, while freedom and liberty requires commitment
and—gasp—responsibility.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If ye love wealth greater than liberty, the tranquility of servitude
greater than the animating contest for freedom, go home from us in
peace. We seek not your counsel, nor your arms. Crouch down and lick
the hand that feeds you; May your chains set lightly upon you, and may
posterity forget that ye were our countrymen. — Samuel Adams</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of all the Jews, only a small minority preferred liberty and God’s work
over dependence on handouts. Yes, we see a parallel today with too many
looking toward a government to provide all their needs, instead of
obtaining for themselves.</p>
<p>We live in an age of greed and bailouts.</p>
<p>The church has become weak and slack, as heresies like <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">social justice</a>
become popular fads, replacing an individual responsibility with the
government.</p>
<p>Is it possible for the church to throw off heresies like <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">social justice</a>,
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/05/church-common-good.html">common good</a>, and
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/06/liberal-theology-begins-with-denying-the-bible.html">liberal theology</a>,
and actually perform productive and Godly functions? How many would it
take for the church to once again become effective?</p>
<p>Only 3%.</p>
<p>Only 3% of the Jews returned from captivity to restore Jerusalem. Only
3% of the people fought in the American Revolution and founded a country
— one we see slipping slowly away as the church fades into irrelevance.</p>
<p>If 3% would stand up and challenge perverse theology like social
justice, and actually focus on the true Gospel, we stand a chance of
changing course. If not, churches in the United States will become
exactly as those in Europe — wonderful buildings, but spiritually dead
and ineffective.</p>
<p>The stunning amount of Biblical illiteracy in the pews is sickening.
That illiteracy remains the only way so-called pastors can pawn off
poisonous deceptive liberal theology masquerading as Christianity. If
enough people in the pews possessed basic Biblical knowledge, those
heresies would be stopped cold.</p>
<p>If you’re attending a church focused on pot-lucks, heresies like social
justice, and failing to teach line by line through the entire Bible, you
must ask yourself — is that training equipping you to be combat-ready?</p>
<p>When 3AM arrives, will you respond like Chuck Norris or be slaughtered
like a pig? Don’t make the mistake training will always be available
later. It might not be.</p>
<p>In most of the world for most of the last 2,000 years the church has
been persecuted. Don’t take for granted in the United States we will
<em>always</em> be able to openly meet on Sunday.</p>
<p>What would you do if your pastor and elders were unavailable to you?
Would you have sufficient Bible knowledge to train and equip others, and
defend yourself? Or do you hope a super-hero will always be around to
bail you out of tough spots?</p>
<p>It’s up to you, because at 3AM you’ve got what you’ve got.</p>
<p>If you <em>are</em> unprepared right now, don’t worry about past mistakes. You
can begin immediately to increase your ability to survive in a spiritual
dark alley at 3AM. No matter what level you’re currently at—master or
beginner—the ability to learn more <em>always</em> exists.</p>
<p>How to begin? First, begin with <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/09/5-bible-commentators-you-should-be-listening.html">basic bible commentators</a>.
Men like Chuck Smith, Walter Martin, and others provide a firm
foundation for later study.</p>
<p>Join our <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/rss/podcast.xml">podcast</a> to receive
messages delivered to you automatically. We don’t pester with hard sales
pitches, we simply want to see 3% of the church be prepared for battle,
and throw off dangerous (but popular) heretical fads.</p>
<p>It only requires 3% to change course, will you be one of the few
responding to the call, or one of those preferring to live in deception,
bondage, and ineffectiveness?</p>
<p>Finally, what can we do to help? Do you have questions, issues, or
something you would like to see covered? Let us know! Our mission will
always be to provide tools for your toolbox.</p>
<p>… because it’s 2:59AM.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
