<p>Gratitude usually isn’t a problem — but a lack of gratitude sure is. One
thing I picked up from Zig Ziglar involves thanking members of our
military:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One way that gratitude was demonstrated in Zig’s life occurred when he
saw military personnel. Every time we would see a service person in
uniform he would stop, shake their hand, and say in his booming
Southern drawl, “Thank you for your service.” It didn’t matter where
we were or what we were doing, he would always take the time to thank
them. (http://www.ziglar.com/newsletter/?p=1806)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We don’t see many military in uniform around here as we’re not near a
base. However, when I see one I remember what Zig did, and do the same.</p>
<p>Once of Zig’s associates (like I imagine many others who heard Zig)
adopted the practice, and passed it along to his son as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After watching Mr. Ziglar do this dozens and dozens, if not hundreds
of times, I began implementing it into my own life. … Since I was
traveling with a young child, we were able to board the plane first
and we had seats fairly close to the front of the plane. I was sitting
next to the window and my son was sitting in the aisle seat. Actually,
he was standing up in the seat greeting the passengers with a smile as
they entered. Soon a gentleman in his uniform walked in. As he passed,
my three-year-old with his sweet young voice looked up at him with his
thick tongue elocution and declared, “Thank you for your service!” The
soldier, gray haired, a bit weathered and sure to have seen several
tours of duty—our hero—stopped. He turned around, looked at my son and
pointed his finger directly at Evan, and said,</p>
<p>“And you’re the reason I do it.”</p>
<p>Then he did what could only be written in the best of Hollywood’s
movie scripts. He ripped off a badge on his shoulder—that proud Army
emblem—and he handed it to my young son.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps a lack of gratitude hurts the most. For our military, they’re
out there on the front lines, staying awake so we can sleep well.
Imagine what they feel when they turn on the news and see the vile names
they’re called — and the only reason protesters and politicians can spew
their venom is <em>because</em> those brave souls serve.</p>
<p>It’s the same with parents and children. You struggle and strain to
provide for your children, always hoping they’ll have a better life than
you did. And what do you get? Name-calling. Ingratitude. It hurts.</p>
<p>It just might be the most hurtful thing you can do to a person is fail
to show gratitude.</p>
<p>It just might also be the most hurtful thing you can do to God is fail
to show gratitude.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
