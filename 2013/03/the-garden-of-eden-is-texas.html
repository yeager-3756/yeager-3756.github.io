<p>When I die, I may not go to heaven; I don’t know if they let cowboys

</blockquote>
<p>I just returned from a business trip to Houston. One thing you should
know … I <em>hate</em> travel. My idea of travel involves traversing the six
miles from our town to the next (which has a grocery store). I’d like to
move because the city just installed a stoplight (yep, a <em>single</em>
stoplight). Oh the humanity! Will someone please think of the children?</p>
<p>I don’t just hate travel, I despise, loath, and detest it.</p>
<p>I can talk in front of hundreds of people. No problem. Demon-possessed
zombies? I’m in for the fight. Crisis? Chaos? I’m up for it. Tough, but
I can move through it.</p>
<p>But travel? Away from family?</p>
<p>Doom. White knuckles. Stomachache. Pepto and Tums. Despair (even of
life).</p>
<p>It’s like throwing water on the wicked witch of the east, a silver
bullet to a werewolf, and Kryptonite to Superman. Yep, it’s that bad —
it’s the worst of all possible situations.</p>
<p>I’ll take a flock of demon-possessed zombies any day.</p>
<p>I know what you’re thinking — what a dopey, irrational problem! Wait a
minute, are you scared of the dark? Elevators? Clowns? Heights?
Pteromerhanophobia?
<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Agoraphobia">Agoraphobia</a>?
<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mysophobia">Mysophobia</a>?</p>
<p>At least my loathing is Godly and Biblical — God said it is not good for
man to be alone.</p>
<p>Did I mention I despise travel?</p>
<p>As a result, I ended up in a conversation with God … a lot. Lord, where
is the rental car? How can I get to the motel? Oh, and can you give the
pilots an extra measure of skill? Can you just get me home? Pleeeeease.
NOW (patience being a virtue in most <em>other</em> circumstances).</p>
<p>Yep, I <em>hate</em> traveling away from home — unless the whole family comes
(rule 1: the family sticks together. Always).</p>
<p>Then one morning I was reminded those conversations occurred in the
garden between God and Adam <em>before</em> the curse. Adam had to ask the Lord
for everything. Lord, is it okay to toss the pigskin around? Of course.
Is it okay to have a burger and fries? Naturally. Is it okay to eat
quiche? Negative! <em>Put the fork down, and slowly back away.</em></p>
<p>After eating from the tree of good and evil, Adam believed he knew right
from wrong, and tried to handle things on his own. Well, we know how
well <em>that</em> turned out (note to self — listening to snakes rarely
provides optimum results).</p>
<p>While I was traveling, I frequently spoke (well, begged and sniveled,
but that doesn’t sound as spiritual) to the Lord. Now that I’m back, not
so much.</p>
<p>Just like Adam.</p>
<p>We really haven’t gotten better and better over thousands of years. We
should learn, but usually don’t.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For whatever things were written before were written for our learning,
that we through the patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have
hope. (Romans 15:4 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did I mention I despise travel?</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
