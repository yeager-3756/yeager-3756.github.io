  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Paul probably experienced more problems in life than most of us (at one
point despairing even of life), yet he was able to maintain mission
focus. How? The difference between knowledge and belief.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the Jews five times I received forty stripes minus one. Three
times I was beaten with rods; once I was stoned; three times I was
shipwrecked; a night and a day I have been in the deep; in journeys
often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils of my own
countrymen, in perils of the Gentiles, in perils in the city, in
perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false
brethren; in weariness and toil, in sleeplessness often, in hunger and
thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness; besides the other
things, what comes upon me daily: my deep concern for all the
churches. (2 Corinthians 11:24-28 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On at least one occasion, it was more than he felt he could bear. I’m
sure you’ve never felt like that (sarcasm).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For we do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, of our trouble which
came to us in Asia: that we were burdened beyond measure, above
strength, so that we despaired even of life. (2 Corinthians 1:8 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How do we deal with such things? Paul has the answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication,
with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God…
(Philippians 4:6-7 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You’re told that, but how do you do it? Paul came to this conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not that I speak in regard to need, for I have learned in whatever
state I am, to be content. (Philippians 4:11 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How Paul might have done that is the lesson we need to learn.</p>
<p>Paul was content, perhaps because he knew the Lord better than us. We’ve
all heard “Trust in the LORD with all your heart, And lean not on your
own understanding; (Proverbs 3:5 NKJV).”</p>
<p>But <em>how</em> do you do that? The difference between knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>Every day as I drive over a bridge I have the <em>knowledge</em> that bridge
will safely carry me over to the other side. However, if I didn’t
<em>believe</em> it, there’s not a snowball’s chance in Hell I’d drive over.</p>
<p>All Christians (at least who read the Bible) have knowledge, but only
some develop belief <em>from</em> that knowledge. I’m sure Paul was one of
those — where did Paul end up?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But none of these things move me; nor do I count my life dear to
myself, so that I may finish my race with joy, and the ministry which
I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace
of God. (Acts 20:24 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Put aside those troubling things you can’t do anything about. As Jack
Sparrow is reported to have said “The problem isn’t the problem. The
problem is your attitude about the problem.”</p>
<p>What attitude? Simple — who or what is God to you?</p>
<p>That’s what gets you through from 3AM to 6AM. If your god is unreliable
or uncaring, you’ve got problems.</p>
<p>I’d submit to you it’s not what you <em>know</em> about God which gets you
through the night, but what you <em>believe</em>. Everyone knows standard Bible
verses, yet some make it through trials, others not as well.</p>
<p>Paul told Timothy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not
ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is
able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day. (
2 Timothy 1:12)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you can do that, you’ll end up as Paul.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
