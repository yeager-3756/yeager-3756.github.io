  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Of previous presidential elections, one of the most remembered catch
phrases was “It’s the economy, stupid,” used to remind phone-bank
workers to <em>always</em> steer the conversation back to the economy, as it
was seen as a winning issue for the candidate.</p>
<p>Christians should use a reminder phrase of their own: It’s the truth,
stupid.</p>
<p>I read a <em>lot</em> of blogs, from all viewpoints, on many subjects. For
liberal, progressive “Christians,” one popular topic is the death of
Christianity, and how to survive Christians must abandon traditional
theology and embrace liberal theology.</p>
<p>Lost in their dissertation is what is <em>true</em>, or in other words, what
does the Bible proclaim?</p>
<p>As a representative of liberals, consider Bishop Spong and his 12
thesis. We’ll get these from the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070203143306/http://www.dioceseofnewark.org/jsspong/reform.html">diocese of Newark</a>,
and while we won’t cover every one, you’ll quickly understand the point:
<strong>It’s the Bible, stupid.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Theism, as a way of defining God, is dead. So most theological
God-talk is today meaningless. A new way to speak of God must be
found.</li>
<li>Since God can no longer be conceived in theistic terms, it becomes
nonsensical to seek to understand Jesus as the incarnation of the
theistic deity. So the Christology of the ages is bankrupt.</li>
<li>The biblical story of the perfect and finished creation from which
human beings fell into sin is pre-Darwinian mythology and
post-Darwinian nonsense.</li>
<li>The virgin birth, understood as literal biology, makes Christ’s
divinity, as traditionally understood, impossible.</li>
<li>The miracle stories of the New Testament can no longer be
interpreted in a post-Newtonian world as supernatural events
performed by an incarnate deity.</li>
<li>The view of the cross as the sacrifice for the sins of the world is
a barbarian idea based on primitive concepts of God and must be
dismissed.</li>
<li>Resurrection is an action of God. Jesus was raised into the meaning
of God. It therefore cannot be a physical resuscitation occurring
inside human history.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s look at what some of the twelve points really mean; Spong’s
“Christianity”:</p>
<ul>
<li>Denies the deity of Christ. (#2)</li>
<li>Denies the virgin birth. (#4)</li>
<li>Denies the creation. (#3)</li>
<li>Denies the inerrancy of the Bible. (#2, #3, #4)</li>
<li>Denies the atonement of the cross. (#6, #7)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Bible instructs on <em>all</em> those ideas, and contradicts what Spong
would like us to believe. Your question: is Spong smarter than God and
His Word?</p>
<p>This is the poison of <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/06/the-cult-of-liberal-theology.html">liberal theology</a>
as it infects the church, denying virtually all of Christianity while
maintaining the name. It stems from <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/11/post-modern-philosophy-church.html">post-modern philosophy</a>
and its desire to <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/10/tactics-rebellion.html">rebel against God</a>.</p>
<p>Liberal theology frequently aligns itself with radical far-left
politics. It’s always fun to point out to those people—using their own
liberal theology methods—that <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/04/jesus-was-republican-not-democrat.html">Jesus was a Republican, not a Democrat</a>
(note: people seem to miss the point of the article, so be sure to read
to the end).</p>
<p>You <em>must</em> be careful as the poison of liberalism infests the church.
They may use the same terms, read the same Bible, and even pray, but
make no mistake — liberal theology is <em>not</em> in any way Christian, as
even atheist Christopher Hitches said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would say that if you don’t believe that Jesus of Nazareth was the
Christ and Messiah, and that he rose again from the dead and by his
sacrifice our sins are forgiven, you’re really not in any meaningful
sense a Christian.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You <em>know</em> it’s danger-time when an atheist professes a better
understanding of foundational Christian theology than many pastors
preaching weekly from the pulpit.</p>
<p>It’s time for each person to do their homework and study for themselves.
For those that do, you’ll quickly discover liberalism holds nothing more
than rebellion against God’s Word, and a desire to create a semblance of
Christianity, all while denying its foundation.</p>
<p>It’s the Bible, stupid.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
