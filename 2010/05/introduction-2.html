  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>The church at Corinth certainly had their problems. Not unlike many
churches today, Corinth faced a long list of difficulties.</p>
<ul>
<li>Problems with unity.</li>
<li>Problems with pride.</li>
<li>Problems with divisions.</li>
<li>Problems in marriage (and divorce).</li>
<li>Problems with legalism.</li>
<li>Problems with spiritual gifts.</li>
<li>Problems with order.</li>
<li>Problems understanding the resurrection.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s teaching 2,000
years ago; many of these issues continue causing difficulties in
churches today. It’s Chuck Missler who asked, “Why do Christians
organize their firing squads in circles?”. Why indeed.</p>
<p>Yet many Christians haven’t considered how their actions cause problems
and present a poor image of Christ. How many non-Christians have beliefs
similar to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, @SainterSan I am going to hell, with all of you, and Satan is
going to be so happy to see us that it’s gonna be party
24/7! (http://twitter.com/Monicks/statuses/5378762029)</li>
<li>We’re all going to hell… Save me a seat by the water cooler? We
belong in the VIP room 24/7 eternal party,
FUN! (http://twitter.com/Monicks/statuses/5428305645)</li>
<li>I bought it all—for a while, and then I found out that everyone in
the church hated each other… that lie exposed all the
others (http://twitter.com/tylermassey/status/5509455784)</li>
</ul>
<p>You see, people outside the church <em>are</em> watching. How many souls will
spend eternity in Hell due to the actions of Christians? That thought
alone should change your outlook—and your actions. Yet some would
object, and claim we’re turning Christianity into a “seeker-friendly”
version, devoid of truth and accountability.</p>
<p>Nothing could be further from the truth. Christians must <em>never</em>
compromise truth, but don’t major in the minors either. As those outside
the church see a mess internally—represented by Corinth—what do they
think? Has the church truly represented Christ in truth?</p>
<p>Take a fresh look at Paul’s correction of the church at Corinth, and
consider if your church still has many of these issues. While no church
can ever be perfect, if divisiveness, hostility, immorality, and
arrogance are openly on display, do you wonder why some would rather go
to Hell than be saved?</p>
<p>It’s time for the church to clean house, presenting truth to the world
while avoiding hyprocisy. A tall task to be sure, but one which needs to
be done. Fortunately Paul provides instructions, if the church would
just stop worrying about potlucks and philosophy, and actually teach the
Word, Paul’s instruction might change the church.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But if we are the Body,<br />
Why aren’t His arms reaching,<br />
Why aren’t His hands healing,<br />
Why aren’t His words teaching?<br />
And if we are the Body,<br />
Why aren’t His feet going,<br />
Why is His love not showing them there is a way?<br />
(Casting Crowns “If We are The Body”)</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
