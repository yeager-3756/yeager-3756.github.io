  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>We’ve written on evolution and beginnings for a while now, but the
discussion doesn’t change much; debates over side issues continues to
occur, while the foundations rarely receive much attention. For a sadly
humorous read, find out what happens when <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/06/evolutionary-data.html">evolutionary data</a> is
asked to be supplied, just about everything <em>but</em> scientific evidence
for foundations pops up.</p>
<p>If overwhelming evidence and support for evolution proves it as fact,
someone should be able to supply peer-reviewed, experimental data for
the following (after all, evolution can’t begin, let alone complete,
unless <em>all four</em> are true). We’ll give a tongue-in-cheek summary of the
theory of beginnings and evolution, and then in parentheses give the
scientific principle requiring experimental data.</p>
<ol>
<li>First there was nothing (matter comes from nothing).</li>
<li>And then it exploded (explosions produce order. Mythbusters would
have fun with this one).</li>
<li>From the goo, to the zoo (abiogenesis — life comes from non-life.
Another one for Mythbusters).</li>
<li>To you (new species evolve from mutations).</li>
</ol>
<p>If you don’t have <em>all four</em> of those, evolution doesn’t work. Period.
Yet where are the scientific studies for those four items?</p>
<p>Remember the movie “Apollo 13” where Tom Hanks argues with his fellow
astronauts about what needs to be done to get back to earth? Hanks
states they’re arguing about step 2,214 while they’re on step two.
That’s the way evolution “science” works; evolution attempts to ignore
first steps and instead build their building without a foundation
beginning on the 13th floor — with nothing but air under it
supporting it.</p>
<p>But it’s not science—what experimental data exists for the foundation?
Science should follow the following procedure, known as the
scientific method:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Observation and description of a phenomenon or group of phenomena.</li>
<li>Formulation of an hypothesis to explain the phenomena. In physics,
the hypothesis often takes the form of a causal mechanism or a
mathematical relation.</li>
<li>Use of the hypothesis to predict the existence of other phenomena,
or to predict quantitatively the results of new observations.</li>
<li>Performance of experimental tests of the predictions by several
independent experimenters and properly performed experiments.<br />
<cite>http://teacher.pas.rochester.edu/phy_labs/appendixe/appendixe.html</cite></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s how it (should) work—let’s pick abiogenesis (life springs from
non-life). First, observe it. Hmmm, in trouble right there, no
observations (perhaps in some college dorm-room refrigerator—“When
potato salad goes bad”, but we digress). Struck out on the first pitch.
But suppose it had been observed, then make a hypothesis (guess) as to
<em>how</em> it happened. Then, make predictions, and finally test the
hypothesis via experiment (reproducing it in the lab).</p>
<p>Wow. Doesn’t look like much “science” has occurred with abiogenesis.
It’s still from the goo to the zoo to you … without any science. Without
repeatable, verifiable, published and peer-reviewed experiments <em>it’s
not science</em>! Evolution might be entertaining as philosophy perhaps, but
definitely not science as it fails to follow the scientific method;
first steps in evolution must be taken on faith as they lack data using
… drum-roll please … the scientific method! It’s <em>by
definition</em> unscientific.</p>
<p>Thus, we’re putting this discussion (you can still read <a href="/category/evolution.html">articles on
evolution</a>) on the back burner until they … you
know, actually have <em>science</em> behind them we can discuss. If anyone has
actual science for those foundational principles, please leave a comment
so we can research them (please cite the journal/book/research paper,
experiments, results, people involved, and dates so it’s easier to
look up).</p>
<p>Philosophy might be interesting, but it’s not science.</p>
<p>CASE CLOSED.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
