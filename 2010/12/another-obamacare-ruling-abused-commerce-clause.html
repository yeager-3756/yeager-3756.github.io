  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>We previously noted <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/12/obamacare-end-republic.html">Obamacare ends the republic</a>,
but at least one judge stands against the absurd and twisted idea <em>not</em>
buying a product is commerce. For those judges and others needing a
refresher, let’s review the definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>com·merce — noun. An interchange of goods or commodities, esp. on a
large scale between different countries (foreign commerce) or between
different parts of the same country (domestic commerce); trade;
business.<br />
<cite>http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/commerce</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In previous cases
(<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/commerce-clause-its-abuse.html">RAICH</a>),
the court ruled commerce <em>entirely within a state</em> (<em>intra</em>-state
commerce) could be regulated under <em>inter</em>-state commerce authority. As
bizarre and 1984-esque as that sounds, the national healthcare plan (aka
“Obamacare”) takes it a step further — <em>not</em> engaging in commerce at all
turns out to be interstate commerce.</p>
<p>It’s an huge expansion of federal authority, and by the same
justification the federal government can control when you use the
bathroom, what you eat, what car you drive (and when, and how much),
where you live, whether you use cash, credit, or debit to pay for
purchases (and <em>when</em>), and anything else they dream up.</p>
<p>It’s the end of the Republic. If upheld, the federal government has
unlimited power for any action they wish, and the states and individuals
must bow to the elites running Washington — the exact situation the
Founders desired to avoid as activist judges abuse the commerce clause
to redefine not only The Constitution, but English language.</p>
<p>Fortunately one judge ruled against the abuse, noting the extreme
expansion of federal power under the absurd definition of commerce.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Neither the Supreme Court nor any federal circuit court of appeals has
extended the Commerce Clause powers to compel an individual to
involuntarily enter the stream of commerce by purchasing a commodity
in the private market.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Because an individual’s personal decision to purchase—or decline to
purchase—health insurance from a private provider is beyond the
historical reach of the Commerce Clause, the Necessary and Proper
Clause does not provide a safe sanctuary.<br />
<cite>Virginia vs Kathleen Sebelius 3:10CV199-HEH (Dec 13, 2010)</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar to earlier Supreme justices, he notes if this justification
proceeds <em>no</em> limit on federal control would ever exist. The future
Supreme Court decision on national healthcare will likely be a 5-4
decision; liberal activist judges have no problem vastly expanding
federal power, while constitutional judges won’t be too keen on
redefining English language, and those roles on the court are set. But
one judge will be the swing vote — one judge basically deciding the
future of the Republic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The unchecked expansion of Congressional power to the limits suggested
by the Minimum Essential Coverage Provision would invite unbridled
exercise of federal police powers. At its core, this dispute is not
simply about regulating the business of insurance—or crafting a scheme
of universal health insurance coverage—it’s about in individual’s
right to choose to participate.<br />
<cite>Virginia vs Kathleen Sebelius 3:10CV199-HEH (Dec 13, 2010)</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This judge agrees with previous Supreme Court justices — if this absurd
Commerce Clause abuse is allowed to stand <em>no limits</em> on Federal power
will ever be recognized again. The food police <em>love</em> expanded federal
power as it provides the power to regulate your twinkie intake.</p>
<p>Of course, some actually <em>want</em> to use national healthcare as a tool
towards socialism and massive increases in federal oversight and
control, a not new idea.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the traditional methods of imposing statism or socialism on a
people has been by way of medicine. It’s very easy to disguise a
medical program as a humanitarian project. (Ronald Reagan)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those who pound the table supporting the national healthcare’s abuse of
the commerce clause would do well to consider it also justifies the
Patriot act and it’s monitoring of citizens from the same argument —
even if you <em>don’t</em> engage in interstate commerce, it really is, and can
be regulated and punished if not followed.</p>
<p>Will Obamacare be the end of the Republic? It will if this abusive
interpretation of the commerce clause stands.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who have known freedom and then lost it have never known it
again. (Ronald Reagan)</p>
</blockquote>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
