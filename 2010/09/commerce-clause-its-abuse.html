  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Perhaps you’ve heard the controversy over Obamacare and its
Constitutionality, specifically regarding the commerce clause, as Pelosi
and company claim the commerce clause gives the Federal government the
authority to force you to purchase a product — you’re a criminal simply
for being born if you don’t take action.</p>
<p>Many (most?) normal people who simply read The Constitution see this as
an absurd abuse of the commerce clause, but remember politicians aren’t
normal people; they seek to increase power any way they can.</p>
<p>We won’t make predictions on whether Obamacare will survive the
challenge, but we can note a previous case using the commerce clause and
you’ll get an idea of how politicians believe they can use the commerce
clause to do whatever they want without restriction, and how courts grab
things out of thin air nobody else would ever consider based on the
plain text.</p>
<p>The 2005 GONZALES v. RAICH SCOTUS case involves a California person
growing marijuana for their own medical use (don’t get hung up on the
“medical marijuana” debate or you’ll miss the point). That’s legal by
California law, but not by Federal law. In the case of conflicting law,
what would the founders proclaim? Should the Federal government have
authority to trample states’ law? That’s the ultimate question before
the court.</p>
<p>The claimed authority comes via the commerce clause — the idea Federal
regulations between states and countries are legitimate use of Federal
authority. But if a person performs an activity which <em>never</em> crosses
state lines, how can the Federal government claim authority via the
commerce clause? What interest does the Federal government have in
regulating private state matters in that situation? See what the
court ruled:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(b) Congress’ power to regulate purely local activities that are part of
an economic “class of activities” that have a substantial effect on
interstate commerce is firmly established. See, e.g., Perez v. United
States, 402 U.S. 146, 151. If Congress decides that the “’total
incidence’” of a practice poses a threat to a national market, it may
regulate the entire class. See, e.g., id., at 154—155. Of particular
relevance here is Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111, 127—128, where, in
rejecting the appellee farmer’s contention that Congress’ admitted power
to regulate the production of wheat for commerce did not authorize
federal regulation of wheat production intended wholly for the
appellee’s own consumption, <strong>the Court established that Congress can
regulate purely intrastate activity that is not itself “commercial,”
i.e., not produced for sale, if it concludes that failure to regulate
that class of activity would undercut the regulation of the interstate
market in that commodity</strong>. The similarities between this case and
Wickard are striking. In both cases, the regulation is <strong>squarely within
Congress’ commerce power because production of the commodity meant for
home consumption, be it wheat or marijuana, has a substantial effect on
supply and demand in the national market for that commodity</strong>.<br />
<cite>GONZALES v. RAICH 545 U.S. 1 (2005) (http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-1454.ZS.html)</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, because he <em>wasn’t</em> buying across state lines (i.e.
interstate commerce), he might affect other areas of the country due to
his <em>lack</em> of purchase, and thus, it’s really interstate commerce, and
the Federal government can regulate it.</p>
<p>Yes, the ruling really means <strong>INTRA</strong>state commerce is now
<strong>INTER</strong>state commerce, (the ruling re-defined the English language).
Doublespeak at its best — Orwell would be proud.</p>
<p>Does anyone with even a vague understanding of the founding fathers
believe they intended such conclusions? When activist courts re-define
language to get whatever opinion they want, <em>any</em> legal arraignment can
be redefined to whatever the Feds desire — The Constitution may as well
not exist as it means nothing. As Justice Thomas said in his dissent:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Respondents Diane Monson and Angel Raich use marijuana that has never
been bought or sold, that has never crossed state lines, and that has
had no demonstrable effect on the national market for marijuana. If
Congress can regulate this under the Commerce Clause, then it can
regulate virtually anything—and the Federal Government is no longer
one of limited and enumerated powers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Justice O’Connor also dissented:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Court’s definition of economic activity is breathtaking. It
defines as economic any activity involving the production,
distribution, and consumption of commodities. And it appears to reason
that when an interstate market for a commodity exists, regulating the
intrastate manufacture or possession of that commodity is
constitutional either because that intrastate activity is itself
economic, or because regulating it is a rational part of regulating
its market.</p>
<p>We would do well to recall how James Madison, the father of the
Constitution, described our system of joint sovereignty to the people
of New York: “The powers delegated by the proposed constitution to the
federal government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in
the State governments are numerous and indefinite… . The powers
reserved to the several States will extend to all the objects which,
in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and
properties of the people, and the internal order, improvement, and
prosperity of the State.” The Federalist No. 45, pp. 292–293 (C.
Rossiter ed. 1961).</p>
<p>Relying on Congress’ abstract assertions, the Court has endorsed
making it a federal crime to grow small amounts of marijuana in one’s
own home for one’s own medicinal use. This overreaching stifles an
express choice by some States, concerned for the lives and liberties
of their people, to regulate medical marijuana differently. If I were
a California citizen, I would not have voted for the medical marijuana
ballot initiative; if I were a California legislator I would not have
supported the Compassionate Use Act. But whatever the wisdom of
California’s experiment with medical marijuana, the federalism
principles that have driven our Commerce Clause cases require that
room for experiment be protected in this case. For these reasons
I dissent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In essence, the verbal twister on defining interstate commerce gives the
government unlimited power to do <em>anything</em>, as both Justice Thomas and
Justice O’Connor note.</p>
<p>Expect to see similar lines of argument in support of the newly expanded
Federal power grabbed by the national health care law. Again, don’t
become involved in the issue of national health care, but be <em>very</em>
concerned about the staggering increase in Federal power. Ask yourself
one question:</p>
<p>If the act is upheld, do <em>any</em> limits on Federal power remain? Does The
Constitution maintain any limits, or continue to protect any rights?</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
