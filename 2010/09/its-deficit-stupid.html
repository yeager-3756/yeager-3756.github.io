  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Remember James Carville’s famous slogan for the Clinton campaign—“it’s
the economy, stupid”? It was meant to remind staffers to always stay on
message, and the message was the economy. With that single issue,
Clinton won the election.</p>
<p>Today it’s massive Federal debt, and the yearly deficit topping a
Trillion dollars. The bigger problem? The official numbers don’t tell
the real story:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/trillion_in_debt_ZIrWsnLp5l9MAQGe8YTG8J" title="Does anyone know what the US owes?">
<p>While the official number — $13.4 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office — is frightening enough, some analysts say the actual figure is much, much higher. Like a shopaholic who hides their credit card bills, the government pretends certain obligations and expenditures don’t exist. Uncle Sam really owes closer to $60 trillion, or more, and the country is close to&nbsp;bankruptcy.</p>
<p>“<b>The government is lying about the amount of debt</b>,” says Laurence Kotlikoff, an economist at Boston University and co-author of “The Coming Generational Storm: What You Need to Know about America’s Economic Future.” “<b>It is engaging in Enron accounting</b>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The issue <em>finally</em> gets some traction as people slowly begin to
comprehend the massive amount of debt the Federal government obligated
their children to pay—and continues to ring up Trillions more in
stimulus, new entitlements, and pork spending.</p>
<p>To put it in perspective, the current administration touts their deficit
reduction plans, but it could take a decade before the yearly deficit
gets back to President Bush levels! Of course, President Bush wasn’t
known for spending frugally, running up large amounts of wasteful
spending himself; instead of acting responsibly, the current
administration doubles down on spending, taking irresponsibility to
stunning new heights.</p>
<p>Worse, the official reports don’t provide a complete picture. Remember
the “Federal surplus” of a few years ago? No such surplus ever existed,
a fact easily (but tediously) verifiable from US Treasury reports.</p>
<p>Your mission (should you decide to accept it—and you should)
is two-fold:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Learn</em> the deceptions, and understand the truth.</li>
<li><em>Share</em> the truth with others. Many won’t want accept the truth, but
keep trying. Provide them with facts and encourage truth-deniers to
verify it for themselves.</li>
</ol>
<p>Interested in the truth but don’t want to take days to do the research
yourself? We’ve done the boring homework for you — just read our article
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/06/truth-lie-myth-surplus.html">Myth of the Surplus</a>
for complete details, containing links to all the government reports and
analysis of what they’re not telling you (our article even has a PDF
version nicely formatted with all the charts and graphs. See the
previous link). <em>We do the work so you don’t have to</em>.</p>
<p>Then move on to another area where government reporting has been… ummm …
less than accurate (actually, they admit they made it up). Interested?
Read <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/06/truth-lie-stimulus-jobs-saved-or-created.html">Truth-lie: Myth of the Stimulus</a>.</p>
<p>It may be a cliche, but it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out
reckless spending is unsustainable and a recipe for disaster. Yet is it
incompetence or actually the desired outcome? Find out about the
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/07/cloward-piven-strategy.html">Cloward and Piven Strategy</a>;
the audacity of deception will take your breath away.</p>
<p>The government reports on the deficit and debt are scary enough; the
truth is much worse, and Washington doesn’t seem to care as they spend
our children’s money, and their children’s, and theirs…</p>
<p>You <em>must</em> accept the mission (did Jim Phelps of Mission Impossible ever
refuse?), quite literally the future of the Republic is at risk. What
will you leave your children? If you don’t have kids, remember Paul
reminds us it is <em>required</em> of stewards that they be faithful — you’re a
steward of the Republic, and your country needs you — you <em>can</em> make
a difference.</p>
<p>Will you answer the call?</p>
<p><strong>CALL TO ACTION:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Learn the truth about <em>one</em> of the previous issues.</li>
<li>Share it with 3 friends, or write a letter to the editor—some way to
pass it along.</li>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
