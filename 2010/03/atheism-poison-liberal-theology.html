<p>For some reason, atheists aren’t happy unless they convert religious
people to their dogma. Why? I don’t know, but they frequently display
intolerance, expressing a deep conviction to win converts to the
religion of atheism.</p>
<p>Here’s a statement which isn’t very remarkable, except for the
revelation of the <em>methods</em> atheists should use to win converts.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2010/03/how-to-undercut-christianity-at.html">
<p>If we want to change the mind of the believer then the most effective way is to drive a wedge between their arguments for the existence of God (i.e., natural theology) and the other things they believe based in the Bible.</p>
<p>Once we do this the believer will see very soon afterward that those arguments for God’s existence don’t make a good case. What I’m doing undercuts their faith at the most fundamental level.</p>
<p>And so first <b>we must make them liberals, then agnostics and then atheists</b>. If we attempt to argue them from Christianity to atheism in one fell swoop we will not do it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Make them liberals? We’re not talking politics, liberals means <em>liberal
Christians</em>, and may or may not relate to a political view. “Liberal
Christianity” might not be familiar to you, but it’s taught in major
seminaries across the country. For them, denying the foundational
concepts of orthodox Christianity is all in a days work, and these
people exist as Christians in name only.</p>
<p>Atheists do quite well creating liberal theologians. Just watch any show
“investigating” Jesus, the Bible or similar and you’ll see professors
from national seminaries denying the inerrancy of the Bible,
resurrection of Jesus, virgin birth, and more. These aren’t in any
meaningful way Christians, as atheist Christopher Hitchens says “I would
say that if you don’t believe that Jesus of Nazareth was the Christ and
Messiah, and that he rose again from the dead and by his sacrifice our
sins are forgiven, you’re really not in any meaningful sense a
Christian.”</p>
<p>Those “liberal Christians” aren’t Christians, any more than calling
yourself the President gets you a ride on Air Force One.</p>
<p>The cult of liberal theology is dangerous and heretical. As Paul warned
Timothy these have a form of godliness, but deny the power thereof.
These liberals are ever learning, yet never able to come to the
knowledge of the truth (2 Timothy 2:7), with corrupt minds, and
disapproved concerning the faith. They may have a PhD and other
accolades, but they’re utterly unqualified in basic Biblical knowledge.</p>
<p>Liberal Christians may posses the warm-and-fuzzy felling of religion,
but share nothing with Jesus except ripping off his name.</p>
<p>Once you start accepting liberal theology like <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2008/12/deutero-isaiah-hypothesis.html">Isaiah didn’t write the book bearing his name</a>,
replacement theology (where the church replaces the Jews and Israel in
God’s plan), <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/01/introduction.html">Daniel was really written later</a> or other liberal theology
garbage, it’s at that point you’ve denied God and become an atheist, not
later. Liberal theologians deny most of the major tenets of Christianity
— how can they call themselves Christians?</p>
<p>The progression from orthodox Christianity, to liberalism, finally
arriving at atheism can be subtle, as the change to atheist actually
comes in the first step after rejecting the foundational tenets of
Christianity, not the last small step to atheist.</p>
<p>In a warning, the atheist notes his techniques don’t work on the
traditional Christian, those who reject liberal theology and stand firm
on the Word of God. But if you don’t stand for something, you’ll fall
for anything — including the cult of liberal theology.</p>
<p>Stand firm on the truth, and reject liberal theology which has nothing
in common with Christianity except the name — liberal scholars have
created their own religion and abandoned Christianity. For more
information, Walter Martin has a message titled “The Cult of Liberal
Theology” available at <a href="http://waltermartin.com">http://waltermartin.com</a>.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
