  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>The “debate” continues over the founding of the United States on
Christian principles. When <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/04/first-amendment-separation-church-state.html">Sarah Palin stated the US is a Christian Nation</a>,
atheists went into full spin mode. Can the question be decided as a
matter of facts, or is it only a matter of opinion?</p>
<p>Since this topic repeatedly comes up as atheism attempts to stomp out
God from society, we’ll begin to run posts documenting from historical
records exactly why the atheist belief comes up short, and looks
ridiculous when they try to deny the Christian heritage of the country.
They may <em>wish</em> the country hadn’t been founded on Christian principles,
but as a matter of fact (not opinion), it was.</p>
<p>For today’s factoid, consider an 1892 Supreme Court decision:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But, beyond all these matters, no purpose of action against religion
can be imputed to any legislation, state or national, because this is
a religious people. This is historically true. From the discovery of
this continent to the present hour, there is a single voice making
this affirmation.<br />
<cite>CHURCH OF THE HOLY TRINITY V. UNITED STATES, 143 U. S. 457 (1892), 465</cite></p>
<p>If we examine the constitutions of the various states, we find in them
a constant recognition of religious obligations. Every Constitution of
every one of the forty-four states contains language which, either
directly or by clear implication, <strong>recognizes a profound reverence
for religion, and an assumption that its influence in all human
affairs is essential to the wellbeing of the community</strong>.<br />
<cite>CHURCH OF THE HOLY TRINITY V. UNITED STATES, 143 U. S. 457 (1892), 468</cite></p>
<p>If we pass beyond these matters to a view of American life, as
expressed by its laws, its business, its customs, and its society, we
find every where a clear recognition of the same truth. Among other
matters, note the following: the form of oath universally prevailing,
concluding with an appeal to the Almighty; the custom of opening
sessions of all deliberative bodies and most conventions with prayer;
the prefatory words of all wills, “In the name of God, amen;” the laws
respecting the observance of the Sabbath, with the general cessation
of all secular business, and the closing of courts, legislatures, and
other similar public assemblies on that day; the churches and church
organizations which abound in every city, town, and hamlet; the
multitude of charitable organizations existing every where under
Christian auspices; the gigantic missionary associations, with general
support, and aiming to establish Christian missions in every quarter
of the globe. <strong>These, and many other matters which might be noticed,
add a volume of unofficial declarations to the mass of organic
utterances that this is a Christian nation.</strong><br />
<cite>CHURCH OF THE HOLY TRINITY V. UNITED STATES, 143 U. S. 457 (1892), 471</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Supreme Court states the United States is a Christian nation;
surveys repeatedly demonstrate well over half the country considers
themselves Christian. Thus, when an atheist says things like the
following it’s rather silly, and only demonstrates a lack of historical
knowledge and understanding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our Constitution established a secular government and has no mention
of Jesus, Christianity, or a god of any kind, despite the false
message spread by figures such as Sarah Palin who claim that America
was founded as a Christian nation…<br />
<cite>http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2010/April/Palin-Draws-Heat-over-Christian-Nation-Remarks</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He’s factually wrong.</p>
<p>This atheist disagrees with the United States Supreme court. Perhaps he
hasn’t studied history, or perhaps he’s simply unaware of Supreme Court
decisions. The farther historically you travel back, documents make
clear the country <em>was</em> founded on Christian principles. The
stomp-out-religion idea only arrived recently on the scene, it’s the
ultimate act of judicial activism attempting to change the clear and
obvious meaning of freedom of religion into a prohibition of religion.</p>
<p>Of course, since <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/01/atheism.html">atheism itself is illogical</a>, we shouldn’t be
surprised if atheists express a lack of critical thinking skills and
logic in other areas as well, as their foundational dogma is as absurd
as claiming the moon is made of cheese.</p>
<p>If atheists what to begin a conversation about eliminating religion from
society to match their personal faith, that’s one thing. But denying
history only makes them look silly.</p>
<p>Palin 1, atheists 0.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
