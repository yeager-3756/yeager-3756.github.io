  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>If you watch cable news at all (no matter the channel), you’ve heard of
Jim Wallis and the issue of “social justice” pop up. Mr. Wallis appears
on MSNBC, Huffington Post and of course his own blog. No matter your
leanings, you’ve likely heard his comments about social justice and the
Gospel; allow Jim Wallis to define the gospel the way he sees it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… The issue here is he actually said social justice is a perversion of
the gospel. I believe it is at the heart of the gospel. (MSNBC Countdown)<br />
<cite>http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036677//vp/35845729#35845729</cite></p>
<p>You said social justice was a “perversion of the gospel,” and I
countered that to assert that, instead, it is at the heart of the
gospel and part of the core meaning of biblical faith.<br />
<cite>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-wallis/another-invitation-to-gle_b_497278.html</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Social Justice is integral to Biblical faith, it’s at the heart of the
Gospel. (MSNBC)<br />
<cite>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoD0ceZxRH4</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>… I invited him to a public dialogue to discuss the true meaning of
social justice, which I said was at the heart of the gospel and
integral to biblical faith.</p>
<p><cite>http://blog.sojo.net/2010/05/06/glenn-beck-immigration-and-social-justice/</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Wallis repeatedly states social justice lies at the heart of the
gospel he promotes. The first question becomes what <em>is</em> social justice?
After finding out what social justice is, the next question becomes is
it the essence of the Gospel? These questions become surprisingly easy
to answer — in other words, it’s not a gray area or disagreement of
opinion, it’s a matter of fact.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Social justice is based on the concepts of human rights and equality
and involves a greater degree of economic egalitarianism through
progressive taxation, income redistribution, or even property
redistribution.<br />
<cite>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Economic egalitarianism is a state of economic affairs in which
equality of outcome has been manufactured for all the participants of
a society. It is a founding principle of various forms of socialism,
communalism and cooperative economic organization.<br />
<cite>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_egalitarianism</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Allow the Center for Economic and Social Justice to weigh in with
their definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Social justice encompasses economic justice. … Within the system of
economic justice as defined by Louis Kelso and Mortimer Adler, there
are three essential and interdependent principles: The Principle of
Participation, The Principle of Distribution, and The Principle of
Harmony … The principle of participation describes how one makes
“input” to the economic process in order to make a living … The
principle of distribution defines the “output” or “out-take” rights of
an economic system matched to each person’s labor and capital inputs …
The principle of harmony encompasses the “feedback” or balancing
principles required to detect distortions of either the input or
output principles and to make whatever corrections are needed to
restore a just and balanced economic order for all.<br />
<cite>http://www.cesj.org/thirdway/economicjustice-defined.htm</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, social and economic justice can be summarized as “From
each according to his ability, to each according to his need”, with some
group deciding how much “output” you’re allowed to have from your
“input”; you’ll frequently hear this expressed as someone stating a
group or person doesn’t “need” something — or so much of something — and
it should be taken from them and given to another. To do so is “justice”
and “fair”, at least in their eyes.</p>
<p>Mr. Wallis’ views are clear — he believes the foundation of Christianity
(oops, he said Biblical faith, not Christianity) begins with social
justice, and exists as the heart (i.e. essence) of the Gospel.
Unfortunately Mr. Wallis’ opinion is factually incorrect. Before
continuing, ask yourself what is the Gospel?</p>
<p>When Jim Wallis associates social justice with the Gospel, we don’t have
to accept his opinion as the Bible (specifically Paul) exactly defines
the Gospel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Moreover, brethren, <strong>I declare to you the gospel</strong> which I preached
to you, which also you received and in which you stand, by which also
you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to
you—unless you believed in vain. For I delivered to you first of all
that which I also received: that <strong>Christ died for our sins according
to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the
third day</strong> according to the Scriptures … (1 Corinthians 15:1–4 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strange. No mention of social justice, or regulating inputs and outputs;
Paul must have been negligent in failing to mention the heart of
the Gospel.</p>
<p>Paul negligent? I don’t think so. Every word, every detail of the Bible
exists by inspiration of the Holy Spirit. It’s not the Bible in error,
it’s those attempting to redefine the Biblical Gospel to fit their
political goals; social justice isn’t anywhere to be found in the
Biblical definition of the Gospel. In case it’s not clear, here’s
the Gospel:</p>
<ol>
<li>Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures.</li>
<li>He was buried.</li>
<li>He rose again, according to the Scriptures.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now <em>that’s</em> the good news; no mention of social justice.</p>
<p>Mixing social justice with Christianity (economic justice, equality of
outcome, etc) eliminates God from the Gospel. In the social justice view
of the Gospel, God isn’t even required at all (just government or other
agency enforcing social justice). Is eliminating God now part of the
Gospel? Where did Paul say that?</p>
<p>Obviously mixing social justice with the Gospel isn’t just wrong, it’s
waaaaay wrong. Factually. Without possible disagreement. As wrong as
claiming the sky is pink. Or 2+2=5. Or the earth is flat. Or the moon is
made of cheese. Those are <em>errors of fact</em>, not disagreements of
opinion. This doesn’t mean taking care of the poor, or church potlucks,
are bad. They’re not necessarily (that should go without saying), but
the church must fight against replacing the Gospel as groups attempt to
achieve political ends, not spiritual ones.</p>
<p>In light of the attempt to substitute the Christian Gospel with a false
one for political aims, we must consider the seriousness of re-defining
the Gospel, as Paul warned the Galatians.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the
grace of Christ unto another gospel; Which is not another; but there
be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. But
though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you
than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. As we
said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel
unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.
(Galatians 1:6–9)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or in the New Living Translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am shocked that you are turning away so soon from God, who in his
love and mercy called you to share the eternal life he gives through
Christ. You are already following a different way that pretends to be
the Good News but is not the Good News at all. You are being fooled by
those who twist and change the truth concerning Christ. Let God’s
curse fall on anyone, including myself, who preaches any other message
than the one we told you about. Even if an angel comes from heaven and
preaches any other message, let him be forever cursed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those replacing Paul’s (and thus the Bible’s) Biblical Gospel with a
social one which doesn’t require God, a review of 1 Corinthians 15 is in
order to understand what the Gospel is, the nature of sin, the need for
salvation, and then heed Paul’s warning to the Galatians regarding the
error of accepting those who twist and change the truth into another
gospel sharing little with the true Gospel but the name.</p>
<p>Christians are called to share the eternal life though Christ, <em>not</em>
social justice, thus social justice can’t be the essence of the Gospel
as a matter of fact. For those mixing social justice with the Gospel,
you’re following an ideology which pretends to be the Gospel (good
news), but lacks truth. You’ve been fooled (and who is the father of
lies?); it’s time to return to the truth as social justice has <em>nothing</em>
to do with the Gospel — not even a little.</p>
<p>What do you think? Have you heard a phony Gospel preached? Leave a
comment with your experience, we’d like to hear about it. As always,
comments are invited as long as they’re polite (read our comment policy
if you’re unsure).</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
