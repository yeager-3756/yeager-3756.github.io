<p>A White House adviser (Jim Wallis) compares the Tea Party to libertarian
philosophy, proclaiming it “un-Christian” in support of his brand of
“social justice”, even attempting to use Jesus’ words to support his
opinion. His article raises many questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the Tea Party libertarian?</li>
<li>How should a Christian be involved in politics? Is one party or
philosophy right or wrong?</li>
<li>Does the Tea Party possess un-Christian values?</li>
<li>What relationship should Christians have with government in light of
Romans 13?</li>
<li>If government performs acts against Biblical principles, must
Christians support it?</li>
</ol>
<p>First we’ll address libertarianism, with a focus on differences between
conservatives, the Tea Party, and libertarians. Next time we’ll discuss
Wallis’ use of Romans 13 to justify his view of government Christians
should (must?) support.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the Tea Party is getting such national attention, our God’s
Politics blog is going to begin a dialogue on this question: Just how
Christian is the Tea Party Movement—and the Libertarian political
philosophy that lies behind it?<br />
<cite>http://blog.sojo.net/2010/05/27/how-christian-is-tea-party-libertarianism/</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Wallis begins the <em>first</em> sentence with an incorrect idea, forming
an incorrect foundation for the remainder of his discussion. The Tea
Party is <em>not</em> libertarian, it’s conservative. This error results from
the idea libertarians are some kind of uber-conservative, but as we’ll
see that’s not the case.</p>
<p>Groups like the Tea Party (and to a much lesser extent) libertarians
exist as loosely coupled groups. It’s difficult to make exact statements
as they don’t necessarily have a “platform position” in the same way
Republicrats have (however, the Libertarian party itself <em>does</em> have
a platform).</p>
<p>To understand Mr. Wallis’ error, we must have a sidebar on
political philosophy.</p>
<h2>Libertarianism</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Libertarianism is a political philosophy that holds individual rights
as its supreme value and considers government the major obstacle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clumsy, but the first part is basically true. Libertarian’s place
individual rights foremost. It’s why they support legalized drugs and
prostitution for example, and frequently can be pro-abortion. It’s just
a personal decision, and people should be free to do whatever they want,
according to libertarian ideals.</p>
<p>Wallis’ bias already shows in the second part of his claim. Libertarians
don’t view government as the major obstacle (to what? Wallis’ thought
remains unfinished), rather (as the Founding Fathers stated in the
Declaration of Independence), “That to secure these rights, Governments
are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of
the governed”.</p>
<p>In other words, government should <em>protect</em> God-given rights; government
becomes an obstacle only when it fails to protect those God-given
rights, or worse, when it legislates the <em>removal</em> of those rights.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It [libertarian philosophy] tends to be liberal on cultural and moral
issues and conservative on fiscal, economic, and foreign policy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wrong, wrong, wrong. Libertarians hold conservative fiscal policy
<em>only</em>, while holding liberal positions on moral/social and foreign
policy issues. Granted, they don’t agree for the same <em>reasons</em> with the
left, but the policies of liberals and libertarians in practice create
the same result.</p>
<p>Three legs exist in political discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social/moral policy.</li>
<li>Fiscal policy.</li>
<li>Foreign policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>In social policy, Libertarians believe in legalizing drugs and
prostitution, both extreme far-left liberal positions (everyone does
what is right in their own eyes). Libertarians and Liberals don’t hold
the position for the same reasons, but in the end that doesn’t matter as
the result to society is the same (Ron Paul stated to Judge Napolitano
even abortion can be acceptable to libertarians).</p>
<p>Mr. Wallis is correct on fiscal policy—Libertarians generally accept
conservative fiscal policy, though some in the libertarian group propose
extreme fiscal viewpoints conservatives won’t hold.</p>
<p>But foreign policy Mr. Wallis goes off track. In general, you’ll find
true Libertarians anti-military (some even would claim soldiers as
victims of government brainwashing, but that’s a topic for later),
generally anti-Israel, and more or less isolationist. (How many times
does Ron Paul scream about the “empire” for example, or claim even the
Civil War was “senseless”).</p>
<p>Those aren’t conservative positions, but liberal. Again, justifications
for the policy differ between liberals and libertarians, but the actions
and beliefs equate.</p>
<p>Have you seen Tea Party people proclaim we should not support Israel,
become isolationist, or espouse anti-military views? How many promote
drug legalization? Advocate for legalized prostitution? Pro-abortion?
Those views exist on the far-left liberal side, not the
conservative side.</p>
<p>Libertarians exist with liberal social and foreign policy, while
fiscally conservative (think Dennis Kucinich with a balanced budget). In
short, they’re more in common with the Code Pink wing of the Democratic
party than Rush Limbaugh Conservatives.</p>
<h2>Conservatism and Libertarianism compared</h2>
<p>Ron Paul serves as the primary speaker for the disciples of
libertarianism (few would disagree he’s the standard bearer for the
philosophy). In contrast, Sarah Palin displays a major force in the Tea
Party movement (along with Jim DeMint, Michele Bachmann, Rush Limbaugh,
and a few others). Recently, Judge Napolitano interviewed both Palin and
Paul on his program “Freedom Watch”, and the results illustrate the
differences between Paul (libertarian) and Palin (conservative).</p>
<ul>
<li>Paul (libertarian) — Israel should be treated like “any
other country”.</li>
<li>Palin (conservative) — we should defend Israel.</li>
</ul>
<p>And for social issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Paul (libertarian) — “nullify” laws regarding drugs. Legalize drugs.</li>
<li>Palin (conservative) — not for legalizing drugs.</li>
</ul>
<p>On abortion conservatives and libertarians again differ—from the
Libertarian party platform:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>..we believe that government should be kept out of the matter,
<strong>leaving the question to each person for their conscientious consideration</strong>.<br />
<cite>http://www.lp.org/platform</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds pro-choice, does it not? At the least, it’s not a pro-life
position. But that aligns with libertarian philosophy—let each person do
as they wish, if they want to get an abortion, that’s fine with
libertarian philosophy. Naturally, pro-abortion does <em>not</em> represent a
conservative position.</p>
<p>Libertarian seems to be a popular buzzword today, but much confusion
exists. As we’ve seen, libertarians are not uber-conservative, rather
they’re a mixture of liberal social and foreign policy, with
conservative fiscal policy splashed in. They’re neither left nor right,
but a mixture of two parts liberal, one part conservative.</p>
<p>If you desire a good introduction to the differences between
libertarians and conservatives, watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nQCnSSivas">Freedom Watch</a> for the full
interview and notice where the two philosophies agree, and where
they disagree.</p>
<h2>Libertarianism and Christianity</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In several major aspects of biblical ethics, I would suggest that
Libertarianism falls short.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s generally true (libertarian Christians must justify promotion of
prostitution and drugs, as well as the anti-Israel position many
libertarians express, and a frequently pro-abortion position), but
again, since the Tea Party is <em>not</em> libertarian those problems have no
relevance to any critique of the Tea Party.</p>
<h2>Christians and government</h2>
<p>But with the preliminaries over, the real issue rears its ugly head: how
should Christians relate to the government? Is big government Biblical?
Or small government? Is charity private? Or a government function? Mr.
Wallis rolls out Romans 13 to support his idea government should
forcefully provide charity (forceful charity—an oxymoron).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An anti-government ideology just isn’t biblical. In Romans 13, the
apostle Paul (not the Kentucky Senate candidate) describes the role
and vocation of government; in addition to the church, government also
plays a role in God’s plan and purposes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First off, libertarians agree with conservatives government’s job is to
<em>protect</em> citizens’ rights. That’s hardly anti-government. Those
anti-government people have another name: anarchists; Wallis’ first
point crashes and burns in a spectacular fireball.</p>
<p>Suffice it to state Romans 13 doesn’t proclaim any <em>form</em> of government
right or wrong, only Christians should be lawful citizens and follow the
law—up to the point it contradicts God’s law and the Bible (a point Mr.
Wallis conveniently forgot to mention). Read it for yourself.
We’ll wait.</p>
<h2>Christians and “Social Justice”</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>As you have done to the least of these, says Jesus, “You have done to
me.” And “Blessed are those who are just left alone” has still not
made the list of Beatitudes. To anticipate the Libertarian response,
let me just say that private charity is simply not enough to satisfy
the demands of either fairness or justice, let alone compassion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Wallis promotes government intervention via his brand of “social
justice”. Notice he provides no Biblical references for this position,
for the simple reason none exist; Biblical charity remains a private or
church matter. In short, Christians <em>should</em> be charitable, but it’s the
private persons job to be charitable. Jesus didn’t say “If people aren’t
charitable, have the government take it and redistribute it as they
see fit”.</p>
<p>Wallis painted the Tea Party with the libertarian brush, then proclaimed
libertarian philosophy un-Christian (thus by extension so is the Tea
Party). Since Wallis views it as a failure, he then takes the <em>huge</em>
leap the private charity Jesus proclaimed is insufficient (in Wallis’
view), thus government should step in and seize assets and redistribute
them as <em>it</em> sees fit, all in the name of Jesus. He proclaims that
without <em>any</em> Biblical support, as none exists.</p>
<p>We can have a discussion on the question of whether government <em>should</em>
perform charity and welfare functions, but for Mr. Wallis to attempt to
associate that idea with Jesus is laughable and absurd.</p>
<p>Most sane people believe the poor and disadvantaged should be helped.
The disagreement arises from <em>who</em> can be defined as needy, and <em>where</em>
the support comes from; Wallis’ promotion of forceful government
“charity” should better be called the anti-charity solution.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Libertarians do exist in the Tea Party movement, however, examining
statements of the Tea Party reveals the libertarian section of Tea Party
remains a small minority (as in the country as a whole), not the
fundamental position Mr. Wallis makes it out to be.</p>
<p>Therefore Wallis’ conclusion the Tea Party is “un-Christian” rests on
the false assumption it’s libertarian. Unfortunately, Wallis’ attempt
(either through misinformation, an attempt at deliberate deception, or
some other reason) to paint the Tea Party with the broad brush of
libertarianism is in error.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve got a foundation on the definitions of political
movements, next week we’ll tackle the thorny issue of the relationship
of Christians and government in Romans 13.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
