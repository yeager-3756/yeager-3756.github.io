  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>In our previous article on <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/06/tea-party-charity-social-justice.html">Christians, the tea-party, and Libertarianism</a>
(prompted by Reverend Jim Wallis’ article disparaging the tea-party
movement) one area left un-discussed was the issue of Christians and
Romans 13. Since it can be used it to justify <em>particular</em> actions by
government, it’s time to take a look to see what it says in context.
First, Mr. Wallis’ argument.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Romans 13, the apostle Paul (not the Kentucky Senate candidate)
describes the role and vocation of government; in addition to the
church, government also plays a role in God’s plan and purposes.
Preserving the social order, punishing evil and rewarding good, and
protecting the common good are all prescribed; we are even instructed
to pay taxes for those purposes!<br />
<cite>http://blog.sojo.net/2010/05/27/how-christian-is-tea-party-libertarianism/</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wallis attempts to Biblically justify <em>his</em> particular brand of
government as blessed by God (and we should enthusiastically pay taxes
for), and then using Romans 13 have everyone bow down to it. But let’s
review Romans 13.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no
power but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever
therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and
they that resist shall receive to themselves judgment. For rulers are
not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be
afraid of the power? Do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise
of the same. For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if
thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in
vain; for he is the minister of God, an avenger to execute wrath upon
him that doeth evil. Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for
wrath, but also for conscience sake. For for this cause pay ye tribute
also; for they are God’s ministers, attending continually upon this
very thing. Render therefore to all their dues; tribute to whom
tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to
whom honor. (Romans 13:1–7)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What government did Paul refer to? Who was in power? Rome — and their
stance toward Christianity at the time wasn’t exactly friendly. Wallis
seems to imply government acts like a “good guy” helping God doing His
work; an interpretation which doesn’t mesh with the time Paul wrote.</p>
<p>Wallis’ attempt to misuse Romans 13 to promote specific government
actions as “God’s approved plan” distorts the text; later in the article
he also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… let me just say that private charity is simply not enough to satisfy
the demands of either fairness or justice, let alone compassion. When
the system is designed to protect the privileges of the already strong
and make the weak even more defenseless and vulnerable, something is
wrong with the system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where does the Bible state government should forcefully impose their
view of charity on the country (“social justice”)? And what does Mr.
Wallis desire by his idea of social justice?</p>
<p>Those can be loaded words (and require definition), meaning a range of
anything from traditional private charity to forced government
redistribution (socialism/communism). We’d be interested in further
words from Mr. Wallis on this, as if he refers to private charity as
Jesus spoke, he’s on solid ground and we’d agree, but if more of the
second (as it appears), he’s wandered into areas totally lacking any
Biblical support whatsoever.</p>
<p>We’ll agree God’s plan uses government (that government can be good or
evil), just as every person, every situation, and every atom of the
cosmos does. But Wallis’ mistake comes from applying it to state
Christians should follow <em>particular</em> government action as “God’s
approved plan”.</p>
<p>A difference exists between God <em>allowing</em> an act, and God <em>approving</em>
it; Wallis fails to express the distinction.</p>
<p>Wallis’ idea makes no sense when considered in light of the times Paul
wrote. Did Paul really mean to state Christians should get behind and
support Rome and the persecution? Of course not; Wallis’ conclusion
is wrong.</p>
<p>Wallis’ argument isn’t new, in the 1770’s as the colonies struggled with
separating from England many made the same argument — it’s called
“Divine Rule of Kings” theology. Simply put, it’s a misapplication of
Romans 13 to imply <em>any</em> government action <em>must</em> be supported by
Christians and not opposed, lest they oppose God.</p>
<p>Naturally, it’s supported anytime the government wants to take action
<em>they</em> like, but those same fade into silence when government takes
action they <em>don’t</em> like. Did Mr. Wallis (who appears to lie on the
liberal site of the spectrum) use the same idea to support President
Bush’s policies?</p>
<p>In any event, the issue isn’t new, as the colonies struggled with the
same question; what did the Founders proclaim?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even John Dickinson (not only a signer of the Constitution and the
Governor of Pennsylvania, but also a devout Quaker and thus a member
of a denomination favorably disposed toward the King) recognize the
spiritual basis for the position taken by the Americans:</p>
<p>We claim them [rights] from a higher source—from the King of kings,
and Lord of all the earth. They are not annexed to us by parchments
and seals. They are created in us by the decrees of Providence, which
establish the laws of our nature. They are born with us; exist with
us; and cannot be taken from us by any human power without taking our
lives.<br />
<cite>“Original Intent-The Courts, the Constitution, &amp; Religion” David Barton, page 92–93</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What happened during the colonies struggle against England for
Independence? Hear the words from the past…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of
Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted
among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the
governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive
of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish
it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such
principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall
seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rights don’t come from government, they come from our Creator. We can’t
say it any better than the Declaration of Independence — governments
exist to <em>secure</em> and protect those rights only, not grant them.</p>
<p>So what does Romans 13 state? After all the discussion, it’s rather
simple. Christians should follow the law, unless that law violates
Biblical principles.</p>
<p>Peter said in Acts 5 “We ought to obey God rather than men”. Romans 13
in proper context means Christians should follow government law <em>unless</em>
it violates God’s law (a point Mr. Wallis didn’t mention). It does <em>not</em>
mean government should not be changed, nor that all actions taken by the
government are correct. Simply put, Christians should follow the law (or
change it) unless it conflicts with God’s law, at which point it must be
discarded, or as the Founders said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably
the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute
Despotism, <strong>it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such
Government</strong>, and to provide new Guards for their future security.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The issue was settled long ago (not in favor of Mr. Wallis’ view). Read
the Declaration of Independence as it’s a perfect rebuttal of using
Romans 13 to justify specific government, or the idea Christians should
unconditionally support all government without question. Such a
government ends in tyranny and oppression of its people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in
the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only
by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every
act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a
free people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, any attempt to use Romans 13 to justify a particular brand of
social justice (government should step in and forcefully take from some
people to give to others as <em>it</em> sees fit, instead of charity being a
private matter) is woefully misguided, and stems from a misunderstanding
of Romans 13.</p>
<p>Christians <em>should</em> (must?) be involved in political matters. From the
founding of the country, Christians formed the basis of government;
today we have a heritage and a responsibility Christians largely ignore.
As Paul reminded us, stewards must be faithful.</p>
<p>Yet some don’t like to be involved because politics exists in a cesspool
of corruption. We certainly agree, but we’ve been passed a great legacy,
and it is required in stewards that they be faithful. Don’t let a
renegade interpretation of Romans 13 prevent you from standing up for
Biblical principles in government, working to change those that aren’t.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can
only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves
largesse from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority
always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the
public treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over
loose fiscal policy, always followed by a dictatorship. The average
age of the world’s greatest civilizations has been 200 years.</p>
<p>Great nations rise and fall. The people go from bondage to spiritual
truth, to great courage, from courage to liberty, from liberty to
abundance, from abundance to selfishness, from selfishness to
complacency, from complacency to apathy, from apathy to dependence,
from dependence back again to bondage.<br />
<cite>Attributed to many people, but commonly Sir Alex Fraser Tytler, the “Tytler Circle”</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Founders took us from bondage through spiritual truth, courage, and
liberty. We soon found abundance, but in the last 50 years moved to
selfishness and complacency. How close are we to moving to the last
stages? And the bigger question: can the circle run in reverse, back to
liberty and courage?</p>
<p>As Chuck Missler says, ask people what presents the bigger problem in
the country: ignorance or apathy and you’ll get the response “I don’t
know, and I don’t care”.</p>
<p>It’s time for Christians to stand up. Whatever your political leanings,
all Christians can agree standing up for the Biblical principles the
country was founded on remains correct. Don’t let anyone tell you the
country was not <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/04/first-amendment-separation-church-state.html">founded on Christian principles</a>.</p>
<p>For almost 200 years since the founding of the country, those principles
existed and flourished. It’s a recent development groups desire to
change what the founders left us into something they’d never recognize.
Change may be the popular political buzzword of the day, but that
doesn’t make it right.</p>
<p>Even a casual study of Romans 13 in the context of the time written
completely destroys the idea Christians must blindly support whatever
government exists without question; if you’re interested in studying
this further, begin with these resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our commentary on <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/01/daniel-9.html">Daniel 9</a>; begin
with repentance.</li>
<li>Get the book on Daniel from
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Daniel-Commentary-Darrin-Yeager/dp/1441495312/">Amazon</a>
to see where we’re going.</li>
<li>Find out what <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/04/first-amendment-separation-church-state.html">separation of church and state</a>
<em>really</em> means—very few people understand it in proper historical
context (freedom <em>to</em>, not freedom <em>from</em>).</li>
<li>Read David Barton’s book “Original Intent”. Much of this you will
have never heard of, if all you’ve experienced is history class
in school.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves,
and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will
I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their
land. (2 Chronicles 7:14 KJV)</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
