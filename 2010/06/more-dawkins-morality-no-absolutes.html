  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Previously we noted in an <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/blog/2009/12/problem-morality-where-does-it-come.html">interview with Richard Dawkins</a>,
when asked for his definition of morality he responded “Moral
philosophic reasoning and a shifting zeitgeist.” In short, society
defines whatever it believes is right and wrong. That is, of course,
value relativism where <em>nothing</em> is right or wrong—absolute morality
doesn’t exist according to Dawkins.</p>
<p>The interviewer noticed this, and when prompted to respond Dawkins
replied “What’s to prevent us from saying Hitler wasn’t right?”.</p>
<p>A bizarre place to find yourself in to be sure; Dawkins expresses such
contempt for religion and God he finds himself in the strange place in
justifying his atheism he can’t even say Hitler was evil. Our previous
article pointed that problem out, and asked why Dawkins isn’t troubled
by his strange conclusion.</p>
<p>After some discussion of this on Twitter, a person sent the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@darrinyeager Here is his response to that question.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxdgCxK4VUA I hope this clears it up
for you<br />
<cite>https://twitter.com/GodlessAtheist/status/14930339818</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s another interview with Dawkins when he was asked again the
atheism and morality question. Would Dawkins offer a different view or
clear up what he stated? Is it possible in his previous interview he
simply didn’t express himself clearly?</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxdgCxK4VUA">part of the exchange</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Question: Considering that atheism cannot possibly have any sense of
absolute morality, would it not then be an irrational leap of faith
(which atheists themselves so harshly condemn), for an atheist to
decide between right and wrong?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Dawkins replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dawkins: The absolute morality that the religious person might profess
would include what, stoning people for adultery, death for apostasy,
punishment for breaking the Sabbath; these are all things which are
religiously based absolute moralities.</p>
<p>I don’t think I want an absolute morality. I think I want a morality
that is thought-out, reasoned, argued, discussed—based upon, almost
say—intelligent design. Can we not design our society which has the
sort of morality, the sort of society we want to live in?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First off, his first idea contains the classic “Ignoratio elenchi”
logical fallacy, more commonly known as Red Herring—it’s an attempt to
change the question, or make yourself look good against a straw man
which isn’t relevant to the question. “Look at how bad those religious
people are, thus my solution <em>must</em> be better”.</p>
<p><em>If</em> a God exists, and <em>if</em> He’s all-powerful, all-knowing, and so on,
by definition His morality <em>must</em> be exactly what Dawkins
wants—thought-out and reasoned. Since Dawkins recoils and the mere
thought of God, this possibility doesn’t make sense to him.</p>
<p>Dawkins is so overwhelmed by God-denying he simply can’t help but commit
logical errors in his response, involving religion even when the
question had nothing to do with it. It’s surprising for a man who
desperately wants to eliminate religion and God from all thought he
<em>injects</em> it into a question which doesn’t involve religion and God at
all; his first thoughts reveal much about his bias, lack of
free-thinking, and poor logic.</p>
<p>But on to his response on morality, which doesn’t differ from his
previous answer (“Moral philosophic reasoning and a shifting
zeitgeist”). Dawkins doesn’t <em>want</em> absolute morality, only a morality
which shifts and changes as society desires. Thus, as Dawkins said
previously, “What’s to prevent us from saying Hitler wasn’t right?”—it
completely agrees with his moral view.</p>
<p>In other words, if a society wants to exterminate six million Jews,
Dawkins can’t say it’s wrong, as if a policy was thought-out, reasoned
(in a perverse way), argued, and discussed (it also was legal and
popular), it <em>must</em> be acceptable to Dawkins, which is why Dawkins
remains unable to state Hitler was wrong. After all, if a society wants
to live without Jews, that’s fine using Dawkins moral process, as long
as it’s thought-out and discussed.</p>
<p>That’s a bizarre world to live in, and unlike Dawkins, we’ll state
Hitler was wrong and evil, and it’s unacceptable to exterminate six
million people. Absolutely. Additionally, any view of morality unable to
state evil as evil isn’t a system for morality at all—simply
philosophical justification (i.e.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handwaving">handwaving</a>) for mob rule (or
has been said, without God, anything is possible—including justifying
attempted genocide).</p>
<p>As we concluded before (and this interview didn’t offer anything
different from the previous interview):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Naturally, Dawkins’ suggestion about Hitler likely repulses most
(all?) people, but while many atheists might attempt verbal twister to
avoid the conclusion, Dawkins gets credit for not denying the logical
conclusion of his atheist position and the lack of standard morality
it spawns.</p>
<p>Why this position doesn’t bother him remains troubling.</p>
<p><cite>https://www.dyeager.org/blog/2009/12/problem-morality-where-does-it-come.html</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Far from changing his view, this interview reinforced Dawkins’ previous
statement nothing he views nothing in his atheist bubble as absolutely
right or wrong, only “Moral philosophic reasoning and a shifting
zeitgeist”, more commonly known as value relativism.</p>
<p>Why this doesn’t bother him <em>still</em> remains troubling.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
