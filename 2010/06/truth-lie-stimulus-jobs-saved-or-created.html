<p>Coming on the heals of debunking the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/06/truth-lie-myth-surplus.html">Myth of the Surplus</a>,
deficit-deniers are back at it again with the sequel “Myth of the
Stimulus”, touting a <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/115xx/doc11525/05-25-ARRA.pdf">CBO report (May 26, 2010)</a>
claiming millions of jobs created—but does the report have <em>any</em>
relevance to reality? We’ll quickly see it does not.</p>
<p>But first, the claim, as reported by ABC news.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But today’s CBO report confirms that things could have been much worse
without the stimulus. For instance, the report guesstimates that the
bill created 1.8 million to 4.1 million (a huge spread!) jobs that
wouldn’t have existed otherwise and the unemployment rate would have
been between .7 to 1.5 percent higher without the stimulus.<br />
<cite>http://blogs.abcnews.com/thenote/2010/05/stimulus-raised-gdp-lowered-unemployment.html</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And of course, political talking points were immediately seized by
Senate Democrats.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Critics of the #stimulus listen up - CBO estimates that it put 2.8
million ppl to work in 1st 3 months of 2010.
http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=967<br />
<cite>http://twitter.com/DemWarRoom/status/14764358495</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone claiming the report has any basis in reality hasn’t read it. Of
course, not reading legislation and reports has become the official
pastime in Washington, but we digress.</p>
<p>You don’t need to look up the report, it actually claims “between 1.2
million and 2.8 million” jobs in first quarter of 2010 (the previous
Democratic quote inaccurately only reported the upper number). But just
like <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/06/truth-lie-myth-surplus.html">Myth of the Surplus</a>,
it’s not the numbers in the report, but <em>how</em> they obtained them. If you
recall, Myth of the Surplus explained how political operatives claimed a
surplus by citing CBO numbers, all while the national debt increased.</p>
<p>Those clinging to the absurd idea of the surplus (let’s call them
deficit-deniers) now cite another CBO report claiming a Trillion dollar
“Stimulus” created millions of jobs. The media and others gobbled this
myth up, but failed to verify the absurd claims or do any verifying
research at all. Just like the previous myth and deficit-deniers, the
stimulus-promoters haven’t done their homework as once again the CBO
report doesn’t pass the sniff-test, if you actually use some critical
thinking and analyze the report.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>See, the CBO doesn’t actually count jobs created. Instead, it uses
models that assume that putting taxpayer money into the system results
in additional demand, additional spending, and, consequently,
additional jobs. Before the stimulus passed, it used these models to
predict that the stimulus would create jobs. And now, in analyzing its
effects, it’s using those same models to estimate that it has created
jobs. But because the CBO relies on slightly updated versions of the
same, original models throughout the process, it wouldn’t necessarily
detect the fact that the stimulus didn’t work if that were the case.</p>
<p><strong>CBO director Doug Elmendorf</strong> laid out the CBO’s methodology pretty
clearly, describing the his office’s frequent, legally-required
stimulus reports as <strong>“repeating the same exercises we [already] did
rather than an independent check on it.”</strong> CBO tweaks its models on
the input side, he says—adjusting, for example, how much money the
government has spent. But the <strong>results the CBO reports—like the job
creation figures—are simply a function of the inputs it records, not
real-world counts</strong>.</p>
<p>Following up, the questioner asks for clarification: <strong>“If the
stimulus bill did not do what it was originally forecast to do, then
that would not have been detected by the subsequent analysis, right?”
Elmendorf’s response? “That’s right. That’s right.”</strong><br />
<cite>http://reason.com/blog/2010/03/26/heckuva-job-creation-estimate</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the CBO’s own director, the report isn’t worth the paper
it’s printed on—<em>if</em> you want an accurate picture of reality. If you
actually read the report, it admits it doesn’t rely on or use any <em>real</em>
data, but rather predictive models—the same models used to promote the
stimulus in the first place. Naturally, that makes the results worthless
to anyone with an IQ above single digits.</p>
<p>If you actually <em>read</em> the report, it includes the following disclaimer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…looking at recorded spending to date as well as estimates of the
other effects of ARRA on spending and revenues, CBO has estimated the
law’s impact on employment and economic output using evidence about
the effects of previous similar policies on the economy and using
various mathematical models that represent the workings of the economy.<br />
<cite>http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/115xx/doc11525/05-25-ARRA.pdf (page 9 of PDF)</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, CBO didn’t perform actual counting or use any hard data,
rather it’s an estimate of what they believe <em>should</em> happen (based on
suspect <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian">Keynesian Economics</a>),
not what actually <em>did</em> happen by counting actual job creation. In fact,
the report isn’t news itself—since it repeated the same analysis
promoting the stimulus in the first place, it would be news if the
report <em>didn’t</em> yield huge employment gains, since that’s what the
guesstimates originally said.</p>
<p>Anyone touting this report as proof of any actual job gains hasn’t read
it, or is attempting to deliberately deceive you. It’s that simple, as
the report itself (as well as the CBO director) admits they didn’t use
any actual real data.</p>
<p>Of course, if you prefer to live on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_Island">Fantasy Island</a> as Congress and the
Administration do, continue telling the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Lie">big lie</a> in hopes someone believes it
(and many will).</p>
<p>Do your own homework, and always ask what the assumptions and methods
are for any claim. In this case, CBO admits they’re not really
determining any jobs created by an analysis of actual data, but
repeating the earlier projections and assumptions of what the stimulus
<em>should</em> do, if everyone lived on Fantasy Island (and assuming
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian">Keynesian Economics</a> really
works, which is suspect).</p>
<p>This myth isn’t really a truth-lie, for it doesn’t contain <em>any</em> truth
at all; those blindly accepting it and believing mythical job creation
figures should say hello to Tattoo and Mr. Roarke for us as we prefer to
stay in reality and won’t be traveling with you to Fantasy Island.</p>
<p>After all, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four">Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia</a>.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
