    <h1>The Increasing Federal Deficit</h1>

  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>The yearly Federal budget deficit is on everyone’s mind these days. Many
use it to score political points, but with few exceptions, both
political parties failed the American people in controlling the debt
monster. Certainly the debt isn’t a new problem to this administration —
remember <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mfMG66LtVU">SchoolHouse Rock</a>
from decades ago?</p>
<p>First, let’s define terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Federal Debt — the total amount the federal government owes, similar
to the balance on a credit card.</li>
<li>Federal Deficit — the yearly amount the government spends above what
it takes in, like spending on a credit card after you’ve spent your
entire paycheck.</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently the <a href="http://www.usdebtclock.org/">debt clock</a> shows total
Federal debt just short of $13 Trillion dollars. How much is that? It’s
just a bit over $40,000 for every man, woman, and child in the United
States (can your children pay that?). You have to pay that much <em>more</em>
in taxes than you pay now, assuming the deficit spending stops
immediately. Of course, Congress and the President are <em>increasing</em> the
yearly deficit at unprecedented levels.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/2010-04-fed-deficit.png" class="floatright" width="407" height="308" /></p>
<p>Remember deficit spending — whether by the government or yourself on a
credit card — is a presumption on the future. It’s spending tomorrow’s
money today, as Wimpy from Popeye noted “I’ll gladly pay you Tuesday for
a hamburger today”. Of course, that money at some point must be paid,
but deficit spending is the ultimate kick-the-can-down-the-road strategy
by hoping the bill never comes due, or letting someone else pay
it later.</p>
<p>Yet President Obama and the Congress have almost <em>tripled</em> the deficit
in just two years (from just under $600 billion in 2008 to $1.4
Trillion and $1.6 Trillion in 2009 and 2010), projecting huge deficits
far into the future. Obviously, that’s unsustainable. What to do? In
spite of all the drivel coming from Washington, it’s really simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reduce spending.</li>
<li>Raise taxes.</li>
<li>Inflate the currency (print more money).</li>
<li>A combination of all three.</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, neither Congress nor the President have any desire to
reduce spending, and in fact are <em>increasing</em> it at unprecedented
levels. So reducing spending is out. Raise taxes? Quite possible, but
with the deficit increasing it will take <em>huge</em> tax increases to have an
effect. How about inflating the currency? The world has seen this
before, as countries print more money to pay off their debt. Of course,
that’s massive inflation as well.</p>
<p>We haven’t even mentioned Social Security being broke, or other
entitlements which make the problem much worse. Obviously the debt is
serious stuff, and requires serious leadership to solve. Most people
understand there’s no free lunch, but will someone please inform
Washington? They don’t seem to understand, and haven’t for a looooong
time — it’s so much fun spending other peoples money!</p>
<p>The increasing deficit and debt can’t continue forever, and when
something can’t continue forever, it <em>will</em> end — the only questions are
<em>when</em> and <em>how</em> (as in how painful will it be when Washington’s party
with your credit card expires).</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
