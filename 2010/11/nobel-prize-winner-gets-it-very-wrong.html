  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Paul Krugman doesn’t hide his far-left leanings (calling his blog the
“conscience of a liberal”), perhaps why his economic policies frequently
come out rather bizarre and slanted.</p>
<p>Recently Mr. Krugman noted personal debt, as a percentage of personal
income, has shot up from 60% in 1985 to 115% in 2007. Since today people
have to pay back that debt, demand for products has gone flat; he
laments over solutions:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/15/the-problem/">
<p>The question is, what will replace their spending? We’re told that we can’t have fiscal expansion, because that’s Big Government. And now we’re being told that we can’t have monetary expansion, which might induce businesses and low-debt consumers to spend more, because that’s debasing the dollar. Oh, and while we’re on that, we can’t allow the dollar to fall, which might help&nbsp;exports.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In case you missed it, monetary expansion is a code for <em>inflation</em>, as
the government begins
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/11/buzzword-alert-quantitative-easing.html">QE2</a>.
Inflation is a hidden tax, or transfer of your assets to the government.
Perhaps you’ve heard of “Keynesian economic theory” recently as it’s
quite popular today while it promotes stimulus and deficit spending. But
what did Keynes himself say?</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15776/15776-h/15776-h.htm" title="The Economic Consequences of the Peace">
<p>Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the Capitalist System was to debauch the currency. By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method they not only confiscate, but they confiscate arbitrarily; and, while the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some.&nbsp;…</p>
<p>Lenin was certainly right. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose. (John Maynard Keynes “The Economic Consequences of the Peace” chapter 6&nbsp;)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inflation isn’t the only problem; Krugman (a Nobel prize winner in
economics), fails to understand what personal debt implies. Borrowing
simply means the demand for goods and services has been pulled forward
from future years. Think about that for a bit. If you buy a big-screen
TV today on credit, that means you’ll have less income to spend later as
you make monthly payments on it. Next year you can’t buy the blu-ray
player, at least until you pay off the TV.</p>
<p>To use a popular term, spending levels (on both a personal <em>and</em>
government level) are <em>unsustainable</em>.</p>
<p>How a Nobel prize winner in <em>economics</em> fails to grasp such a simple
concept remains a mystery.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to the Federal Government and their current
borrow-and-spend policies (with Trillion dollar deficits, new Trillion
dollar entitlements, and <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/06/truth-lie-stimulus-jobs-saved-or-created.html">Trillion dollar “stimulus” spending</a>).
As we’ve seen in Europe, that simply can’t continue (as it’s just
pulled-forward demand); at some point you’ve got to stop spending and
pay back the debt.</p>
<p>You’ll hear more and more about “government austerity measures”, meaning
cutting spending to use money to pay back accumulated debt (they’ve
essentially spent on <em>your</em> credit card). It’s inevitable, and <em>must</em>
happen unless the government defaults and declares bankruptcy. As any
person knows — or learns the hard way — you can’t spend on your credit
card forever — sooner or later the bank wants their money back, and when
they do, you’ll have less to spend as a chunk of your paycheck goes to
pay back the debt … with interest.</p>
<p>The problem is the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/04/increasing-federal-deficit.html">increasing Federal deficit</a>
caused by wildly irresponsible spending, and the fantasy idea the
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/06/truth-lie-myth-surplus.html">government had a surplus</a>
in recent history. The fact remains the Federal government has run a
deficit for decades, and the problem only gets worse. Much worse.</p>
<p>It’s irresponsible spending, not revenue, causing the problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen six, result
happiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty
pound ought and six, result misery. (Charles Dickens, “David Copperfield”)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Naturally, our friendly Nobel prize winner Mr. Krugman has a solution,
saying the deficit will be solved by “death panels and sales taxes”, but
strangely, he never mentioned a spending problem.</p>
<p>Simply put, his idea uses the national health-care plan (aka
“Obamacare”) to ration medical care and slash the medical treatment
you’ll receive, and then raise taxes on anyone surviving the reduced
medical care. Funny, he never mentioned cutting spending … not one cent
(as it turns out, everyone who noted the national health-care plan would
involve death panels turns out to be correct).</p>
<p>Mr. Krugman provides yet another lesson — anyone with a PhD, or Nobel
prize, or other fancy letters after their name can be just as wrong as
anyone else. In this example, a Nobel-prize economist can’t understand
the basic principle noted by Charles Dickens — you can’t continue to
increase spending.</p>
<p>Or as Margaret Thatcher noted — “The problem with socialism is that you
eventually run out of other people’s money”.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
