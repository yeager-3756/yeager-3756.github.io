<p>Today’s drama stars Mr. Banker and Mr. Fed, and our hero Quantitative
Easing. It’s a production you won’t want to miss, because you’re one of
the cast! Will our hero be able to save the masses from economic
calamity? Or will the hero turn out to be a zero? Join the cast of
millions as our hero burns through Billions in cash like he created it
out of thin air! A must-see drama! Gripping! Thrilling! Suspenseful!</p>
<p>You’re going to hear much about Quantitative Easing in the coming weeks,
as the Fed desperately tries to manipulate the economy to move again.
Much will be written for and against it, but what is it, and why is the
Fed pursuing the strategy?</p>
<p>If you subscribe to the idea government stimulus provides the way out of
economic depression, you must find a way to inject more “stimulus” into
the economy. However, almost everyone agrees another $800 Billion
stimulus isn’t going to happen (the first <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/06/truth-lie-stimulus-jobs-saved-or-created.html">stimulus didn’t work</a>
out so well), so how to use “stimulus” to spend another $800 Billion or
so without <em>calling</em> it stimulus?</p>
<p>Enter Quantitative Easing, stage left (cue the spooky music).</p>
<p>It works like this. Suppose Mr. Banker holds $10 Billion in bonds or
other assets. Nobody wants to buy them right now, so the Mr. Banker just
sits on them, tying up resources. The Fed comes along and says, hey,
we’ll buy them for more than the market will pay right now, and Mr.
Banker says “sweet!”, and takes the Fed’s cash in exchange for the
assets Mr. Banker couldn’t sell anyway. The theory says when Mr. Banker
suddenly has his pockets stuffed with fresh dollars from Mr. Fed, he’ll
loan them to business, and presto! Instant recovery.</p>
<p>Lather, rinse, repeat (with many banks) and suddenly you’ve “stimulated”
the economy with another Trillion dollars or so … all without calling
it stimulus!</p>
<p>Here’s where the fun starts (or the tragedy begins) — where does Mr. Fed
get the money to pay Mr. Banker? Mr. Fed creates it out of thin air.
That’s right, crank up the printing press Ma, we need another
$800 Billion!</p>
<p>If you wondered this will cause inflation, ding ding ding! Winner!
Exactly. At some point the economy figures out many more dollars exist
out there, and prices rise accordingly to the supply of money. Of
course, the Fed (and politicians) hope they (before hyperinflation sets
in) can suck out that money before anything bad happens, like, you know,
certain economic destruction.</p>
<p>And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how Quantitative Easing works. If it
sounds scary and risky, you don’t need to adjust the colors on your TV,
because it <em>is</em> scary and risky.</p>
<p>Conveniently, the Fed will begin this plan just <em>after</em> the election.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
