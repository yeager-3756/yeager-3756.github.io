<p>The problem with the Bible is our copies are almost 2,000 years old.
Even if the original accounts are accurate, over the many thousands of
years errors have crept in. We can never know if the copyist made errors
or not, since we don’t have the original copies. And how do we know the
original accounts are accurate? Who is to say they didn’t make things
up? We can never know.</p>
<h2>THE DEFENSE</h2>
<p>Let’s look at the men who wrote the accounts of the life of Jesus.
Matthew was a Jew and was with Jesus for several years. He was an
eyewitness. So to with John. The Gospel of Mark is basically Peter’s
Gospel, since Mark drew upon Peter for much of his account.</p>
<p>Luke is different. Luke was not necessarily a witness to these events,
but gets his information directly from people who were. This is
important for several reasons. First, eyewitness testimony is credible.
As the jury knows, hearsay is excluded from testimony; only eyewitness
testimony is allowable. Luke is recording the credible eyewitness
testimony of people who experienced these events, just as our court
reporter is recording the testimony in this courtroom. Thus, his gospel
account is authoritative.</p>
<p>But, what good is testimony if the recording of it is inaccurate? The
prosecution would have you believe the Bible is not credible, for since
we don’t have any of the original copies of the Bible, through the
copying and copying over thousands of years, errors have crept into the
text. Thus the recording of eyewitness testimony as Luke does is
invalid. But, a quick glance of the following chart (Eastman and Missler
“The Bible: An Extraterrestrial Message” page 10) illustrates the
accuracy of the New Testament as it has been passed down to us:</p>

<p>If we don’t accept the validity and accuracy of the Bible, we will have
to throw out much more than the Bible. Do we doubt the writings with
considerably less sources? The existence of George Washington? The Bible
is unique in the considerable manuscript evidence for it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Norman Geisler, a world renown Bible scholar echoed this when he
states: “Only 400 words of the NT are in doubt, whereas 764 lines of
the Iliad are questioned. This five percent textual corruption (in the
Iliad) compares with one-half of one percent of similar emendations in
the New Testament”(Eastman and Missler “The Bible: An Extraterrestrial
Message” page 11)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the Bible has been preserved through the centuries for us as it was
originally written, but was it written accurately in the first place?
Could the Gospel writers add to their accounts or fabricate stories to
make the story look better? Consider the following.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from
thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee. But he turned, and said unto
Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for
thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of
men. (Matthew 16:22-23 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus is rebuking satan from Peter! If you were making something up,
would you fabricate something to make you look bad?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet
dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the
sepulchre. Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the
other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken
away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have
laid him. Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and
came to the sepulchre. So they ran both together: and the other
disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre. And he
stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went
he not in. Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the
sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie, And the napkin, that was
about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together
in a place by itself. Then went in also that other disciple, which
came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed. <span
class="Underline">For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must
rise again from the dead</span>. (John 20:1-9 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John admits the disciples didn’t understand Jesus would rise from the
dead. This is an important concept in Christianity, and he admits they
didn’t understand Jesus’ teaching! Why would you include such damaging
evidence if you were making the story up? The fact these stories are
included gives credibility to the claim the Gospels are a true and
accurate representation of the life of Jesus.</p>
<p>But more importantly, three Gospel accounts were written within 20-35
years after Jesus’ death (John’s Gospel within 50 years). The Jews
certainly wanted to see Christianity fade out, so if the Gospel writers
made exaggerated claims, wouldn’t the Jews have pointed these things
out? We’ve already established the Bible has been passed down to us
virtually unaltered over the generations. So if there are errors, why
didn’t the Jews speak out and correct them? Many of the people involved
were still alive, so if an error occurred, it would be easy to verify
with the person mentioned.</p>
<p>Conclusion: The four Gospels are accurate and reliable. Not only have
they been transmitted to us accurately, but they are an accurate
eyewitness account of these events.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
