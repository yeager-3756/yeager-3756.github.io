<p>Let’s be real here. Bringing back a person from the dead? Hocus-pocus
stuff. Modern, enlightened people don’t believe such fairy tales. As for
the appearances after Jesus’ death, the disciples were delusional; they
simply saw what they wanted to see.</p>
<h2>THE DEFENSE</h2>
<p>Several rebuttal arguments must be made here. First, soldiers were
guarding the tomb of Jesus. As already mentioned, they were highly
motivated to insure the tomb was not tampered with - if Jesus escaped,
the soldiers paid with their life. To believe Jesus somehow was revived
in the tomb, and then without medical attention was able to get up (with
holes in his feet), move the boulder covering the entrance (with
dislocated shoulders and holes in the hands), and sneak quietly passed
an armed detachment of highly trained Roman soldiers is difficult
to imagine.</p>
<p>But imagine if Jesus was somehow able to survive and sneak out, would a
person who had these medical problems be able to inspire the disciples
(and others) to carry on His message that He was able to conquer death?
Illogical. The disciples and others were all killed for their faith in
Jesus. If a beat up, near death person appeared to you, would it inspire
you to give your life for a deception? Wouldn’t <em>one</em> of these many have
given in as they were being whipped and crucified themselves? Logic
would dictate at least one would have admitted the lie to save his own
life. But none did.</p>
<p>The prosecution would have you believe some sort of mass delusion
explains the tales of Jesus appearing after His death. But delusions are
personal and individual. Are we to believe all the disciples at once had
the same delusional vision when they saw Jesus together? Impossible.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Jewish leaders also were motivated to prove the resurrection
a hoax. All they had to do was produce the body. But they couldn’t.</p>
<p>It may have occurred to you we have no witnesses to the actual event of
the resurrection. But if we show Jesus was dead, and later seen alive,
what conclusion can we draw? After all, dead men tell no tales. The
first evidence is from Paul.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how
that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he
was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the
scriptures: And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: <span
class="Underline">After that, he was seen of above five hundred
brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this
present</span>, but some are fallen asleep. After that, he was seen of
James; then of all the apostles. And last of all he was seen of me
also, as of one born out of due time. (1 Corinthians 15:3-8)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul wrote his letter to the Corinthians very early; it predates the
Gospel accounts. Paul begs people to check out his claim since the
witnesses are still alive! If Paul made this up, would he have invited
people to check it out? The resurrection is no legendary account. Paul
wrote only about 20 years after the event, much to early for legend
to develop.</p>
<p>The Gospels also have several accounts of post-resurrection appearances.
Are we to discredit them also? For what reason? Just because we don’t
want to believe it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without question, the amount of testimony and corroboration of Jesus’
post-Resurrection appearances is staggering. To put it in perspective,
if you were to call each one of the witnesses to a court of law to be
cross-examined for just fifteen minutes each, and you went around the
clock without a break, it would take you from breakfast on Monday
until dinner on Friday to hear them all. After listening to 129
straight hours of eyewitness testimony, who could possibly walk away
unconvinced? Lee Strobel “The Case for Christ” page 237)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, think of all the other trials whose outcome is determined on
much less testimony.</p>
<p>Any of the prosecutions arguments to explain the resurrection is more
difficult to believe than the truth: Jesus is God, so He has the power
to do what He wants. For a God who created the universe to begin with,
resurrection is no problem.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
