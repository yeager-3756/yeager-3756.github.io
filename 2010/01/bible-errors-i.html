<p>We will show the most important doctrine of the Bible is in question,
that of the way to salvation. Jesus, and later James, taught a salvation
by works, while Paul taught a salvation by faith alone. Since the most
important doctrine of the Bible is in question, we can ignore the rest.
As the judge will tell you, if a witness lies about part of his
testimony, you can ignore the rest of it as unreliable. Since the Bible
is in contradiction here, we need look no further and can ignore the
rest of its testimony.</p>
<h3>Prosecution Exhibit “A” - Matthew 5:17, James 2:14, Romans 3:28, Galatians 2:16, Ephesians 2:8</h3>
<p>In the Gospels, Jesus teaches salvation comes by works - He says to
enter the kingdom of heaven, your righteousness must exceed the
righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees. The scribes and Pharisees
were the most religious people of the day, and meticulously followed the
law of Moses as contained in the Old Testament. Jesus means we must
follow the law better than they did in order to get to heaven. Obviously
this means salvation is by works.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not
come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven
and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the
law, till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of
these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called
the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach
them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I
say unto you, That <span class="Underline">except your righteousness
shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall
in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven</span>. (Matthew
5:17-20 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But not only Jesus, but later in the book of James, James teaches
salvation by works also.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and
have not works? can faith save him? (James 2:14 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But compare this to the writings of Paul, who clearly teaches salvation
by faith alone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the
deeds of the law. (Romans 3:28 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by
the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that
we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of
the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.
(Galatians 2:16 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Salvation is the most important doctrine in the Bible. If it can’t be
consistent, what reason is there to continue? Throw out this archaic
book as inconsistent and out of date.</p>
<h2>THE DEFENSE</h2>
<p>This is not a contradiction. Salvation is by faith alone, as Paul
teaches. Jesus (we’ll get to James in a minute) teaches salvation comes
by faith alone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth
the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will
raise him up at the last day. (John 6:40)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath
everlasting life. (John 6:47)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus teaches salvation by faith alone. If we look at the crucifixion of
Jesus, we note He was crucified between two thieves. The crowd (and the
two thieves) mock Jesus, and say “He saved others, but can’t save
Himself”. One of the thieves joins in the mocking of Jesus. But as all
three hang there, an interesting thing happens to one of them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God,
seeing thou art in the same condemnation? And we indeed justly; for we
receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing
amiss. <span class="Underline">And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember
me when thou comest into thy kingdom</span>. (Luke 23:40-42 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And what was Jesus response to this request?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, <span
class="Underline">To day shalt thou be with me in paradise</span>.
(Luke 23:43 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What work had this man done to deserve salvation? He was being executed
by Rome for his crimes! Can we say his righteousness exceeded the
Pharisees? It doesn’t appear so. Yet Jesus says this criminal was saved</p>
<ul>
<li>not by works, but by faith in who Jesus is.</li>
</ul>
<p>The prosecution simply misunderstands Jesus in the previously cited
verses. Far from teaching salvation comes from works, this passage
confirms works are <em>insufficient</em> for salvation. As the prosecution
points out, the Pharisees were the most religious people alive at that
time. They strived, in fact, they <em>lived</em> to keep the law of Moses. But
as Paul points out, works cannot save you. If we take what Paul said as
true, the prosecution would have you believe Jesus’ statement (and
James’ also) must be false. But that shows his misunderstanding of this
passage. If salvation came by works, the Pharisees <em>would</em> be saved,
since they were the most religious people alive (as the prosecution
points out). But Jesus doesn’t say the Pharisees <em>are</em> saved, only <em>to
be saved</em> your righteousness must <em>exceed</em> that of the Pharisees. Jesus
never refers to the Pharisees as saved; He had extremely harsh words for
the Pharisees.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="Underline">Ye are of your father the devil</span>, and
the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the
beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in
him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar,
and the father of it. (John 8:44 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the most religious people alive are not saved; so the question is,
how can I be saved? If the righteousness of the Pharisees is
insufficient, how can I exceed the righteousness of the Pharisees, who
spent day and night following the law of Moses? By having the
righteousness of God. Man by himself can never be righteous. But Paul
talks about a concept in Romans chapter four where we can have God’s
righteousness imputed to us, giving us the example of how Abraham’s
faith was accounted to him as righteousness by God</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;
But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him
that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; Who was delivered for our
offences, and was raised again for our justification. (Romans
4:23-25 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By faith in Jesus Christ, our righteousness exceeds that of the
Pharisees, who clearly rejected Jesus teaching, Messiahship
and Lordship.</p>
<p>The prosecution also makes a big deal from James’ statement that faith
without works cannot save. This issue can best be illustrated with an
example. Suppose I tell you I love my dog. But each day I go home, I
take a baseball bat and beat him with it. Would you say my statement of
faith is true? I don’t think so. In that situation, my works (beating my
dog each day) do not match with my statements. James is saying the same
thing about people who profess to be Christians. If their actions do not
demonstrate a true Christian nature, can their statement alone save
them? No. They were never Christians in the first place. Christianity is
not an outward profession only, or following a list of rules as the
Pharisees did, it is a condition of the heart. If your heart is right,
your outward actions will be in line with your profession. James in no
way teaches salvation by works, he teaches works will be the evidence
<em>of</em> your salvation.</p>
<p>So the most important doctrine - salvation - is consistent through
the Bible.</p>
<h3>Defense exhibit “A” - proving the Bible is the Word of God.</h3>
<p>Although we could continue to demonstrate other “errors” in the Bible
don’t exist, perhaps it would be more constructive to show evidence of
the Bible being the Word of God - it was written by someone with
knowledge beyond human comprehension. What if this book gives us
scientific knowledge we only recently have discovered ourselves? Would
that be evidence this book comes from someone beyond human wisdom? It
turns out we find some of the most advanced scientific concepts in the
Bible. (The Bible: An Extraterrestrial Message page 12-14)</p>
<p>First, the Bible says time and the universe had a beginning. Until
recently, many thought the universe was infinitely old. But we have
recently discovered the universe is expanding, and an expanding universe
presents a problem - if the universe is infinitely old and is expanding
it must expand and contract in a cycle forever, since it cannot expand
forever (blowing up a balloon until it breaks is a crude example of the
principle involved). We now know the universe is expanding only - the
theories of the universe expanding and contracting forever have been
disproved. An expanding universe implies it had a beginning; it has not
existed forever. Einstein himself stubbornly rejected the idea of a
beginning for the universe, and wanted to prove it was infinitely old.
But the big bang theory shows Einstein was wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Einstein tried to avoid such a beginning by creating and holding onto
his cosmological “fudge factor” in his equations until 1931, when
Hubble’s astronomical observations caused him to grudgingly accept
“the necessity for a beginning”. We have already seen how Hoyle
dislikes the idea because, as he puts it, “The big bang theory
requires a recent origin of the universe that openly invites the
concept of creation”. Barry Parker sums up the feelings of most
cosmologists: “If we accept the big bang theory, and most cosmologists
now do, then a ‘creation’ of some sort is forced upon us” (Herren,
Fred “Show Me God” page 107-108)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the idea the universe is not infinitely old is long-standing news to
people who read the Bible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="Underline">In the beginning</span>God created the heaven
and the earth. (Genesis 1:1 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to
the faith of God’s elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is
after godliness; In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie,
promised <span class="Underline">before the world began</span>;
(Titus 1:1-2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was a point when the universe didn’t exist - the Bible says so,
and science recently discovered the same truth. Also, as already
mentioned, the universe is expanding - another scientific discovery we
find in the Bible, as it speaks of God as the one who stretches out
the heavens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou
art clothed with honour and majesty. Who coverest thyself with light
as with a garment: <span class="Underline">who stretchest out the
heavens</span>like a curtain: (Psalms 104:1-2 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus saith God the LORD, <span class="Underline">he that created the
heavens, and stretched them out</span>; he that spread forth the
earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the
people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein: (Isaiah 42:5)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another relatively (few hundred years) new discovery is the world is
round, not flat. As Columbus found out in 1492, most thought the earth
was flat - but not the Bible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is he that sitteth upon <span class="Underline">the circle of the
earth</span>, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that
stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a
tent to dwell in: (Isaiah 40:22 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You may think these are just coincidence, but they just “happen” to
agree with very recent discoveries in science. But there is more. We
find the laws of thermodynamics in the Bible. One of the laws of
thermodynamics is called entropy and is firmly established in science.
Basically, it means things tend to go from order to disorder or chaos;
any parent is familiar with this concept. “Clean your room” is often
heard as a parent speaks to their children. And why? If the child starts
out with a clean room, it tends to become messy later! That is the idea
behind entropy. Entropy says the universe is winding down (this is one
of the reasons the expanding and contracting idea for the universe
doesn’t work). It also means at some point the universe will cease to
exist. This is recent knowledge for man, but not for the Bible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath:
<span class="Underline">for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke,
and the earth shall wax old like a garment</span>, and they that dwell
therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever,
and my righteousness shall not be abolished. (Isaiah 51:6 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="Underline">Heaven and earth shall pass away</span>, but
my words shall not pass away. (Matthew 24:35 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bible has the answers to questions science will never answer - How
did the universe begin? How will it end? Even the big bang cannot
explain the beginnings of the universe, for it soon runs head on into
the planck time problem, where time units smaller than 10<sup>-43</sup> seconds
don’t exist. Simply put, we can <strong>never</strong> understand what happened at
time t=0 in the universe; it is <em>unknowable</em>. (Note: if you understand a
little about quantum mechanics, you understand the previous statement
and its implications, if you don’t it’s not a problem - for the core
arguments here do not rely on understanding quantum physics).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Internationally respected astronomer (and self-confessed agnostic)
Robert Jastrow admits that scientists have been “traumatized” by
coming up against a problem that must forever remain beyond them” [the
idea of how the universe came into existence] … Jastrow concludes his
book [God and the Astronomers] “For the scientist who has lived by his
faith in the power of reason, the story ends like a bad dream. He has
scaled the mountains of ignorance; he is about to conquer the highest
peak; as he pulls himself over the final rock, he is greeted by a band
of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries.” (Herren,
Fred “Show Me God” page 121-122)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bible provides the answers.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
