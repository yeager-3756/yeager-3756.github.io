<p>Jesus never claimed to be God. The belief He is God comes from His
followers. We never see Him make that statement.</p>
<h2>THE DEFENSE</h2>
<p>Let’s just look at a few illustrations to show this is completely false.
First, Jesus claimed to be equal to the Father.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I and my Father are one. (John 10:30 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this was an ambiguous statement, why did the Pharisees react
so violently?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="Underline">Then the Jews took up stones again to stone
him</span>. Jesus answered them, Many good works have I showed you
from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me? The Jews
answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for
blasphemy; and <span class="Underline">because that thou, being a man,
makest thyself God</span>. (John 10:31-33 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They knew exactly what Jesus was claiming - He claimed to be God. This
leaves little room for doubt, at least for the Pharisees. But if we
study the Gospel accounts more closely, we see more evidence for Jesus’
claims to be God. This was not an isolated case, it happened several
other times as well.</p>
<p>In one of Jesus’ many debates with the Pharisees, the subject of the
Pharisees being Abraham’s children arises, and Jesus responds with a
comment of His own.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was
glad. (John 8:56 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is quite a statement. How could Abraham see Jesus? Jesus came
thousands of years after Abraham. This caused problems for the Pharisees
as well, as they respond:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and
hast thou seen Abraham? (John 8:57 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus gives the answer to this problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham
was, I AM. (John 8:58)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a grammatical error we’ll come back to in a minute (it should be
I was, not I AM), but first let’s look at the Pharisees response to
this statement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and
went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed
by. (John 8:59 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, the Pharisees want to stone Jesus. Why would this statement cause
them to want to kill Jesus? The answer is given back in the Old
Testament, in Exodus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of
Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me
unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say
unto them? And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus
shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto
you. (Exodus 3:13-14 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God told Moses to tell Israel His name was “I AM”. By Jesus using the
same phrase, He places himself as the voice from the burning bush that
talked to Moses thousands of years ago. Jesus is claiming to be God; the
Pharisees understood what Jesus is saying, that’s why they wanted to
kill him.</p>
<p>But looking at one more story should suffice. On what we call Palm
Sunday, Jesus made his entrance into Jerusalem riding on a donkey.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And they brought him [the colt - editor] to Jesus: and they cast their
garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon. And as he went,
they spread their clothes in the way. And when he was come nigh, even
now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the
disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all
the mighty works that they had seen; Saying, Blessed be the King that
cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the
highest. (Luke 19:35-38 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This happened a week before Easter. This appears to be a rather benign
event, but again, the Pharisees are angry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him,
Master, rebuke thy disciples. (Luke 19:39 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why would they want Jesus to rebuke His disciples? What’s the problem
here? Notice what the crowd is saying “Blessed be the King that comes in
the name of the Lord”. That’s a title for the Messiah, who is God. The
crowd is claiming Jesus is God, and the Pharisees want Jesus to stop
them, for surely He knows He isn’t God, and wouldn’t want the multitude
to blaspheme. But Jesus doesn’t stop them, He makes a curious remark.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should
hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out. (Luke
19:40 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So again, the Pharisees know Jesus is claiming to be God, and they are
angry. If He wasn’t claiming to be God, they had no reason to want to
kill Him.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
