<p>Atheism is by definition illogical for the simple reason you can’t say
no god exists unless you possess all knowledge. If you don’t know
everything in the cosmos (and outside it), God can exist outside your
knowledge. Atheism doesn’t follow logic while holding an illogical (and
unprovable) position; its followers accept it on faith, without proof,
logic or reason.</p>
<p>The following represents a common statement with faulty logic (though
often repeated):</p>
<blockquote cite="http://twitter.com/randeazie/status/5025276439">
<p>Just a reminder people: There is no god.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only way to make the statement “there is no God” is if you have all
knowledge. Why does it form a logical absurdity? Consider the
following diagram:</p>
<img class="centered svg-resize" src="/images/2014/04/atheism-diagram.svgz" alt="atheism diagram" height="150" width="150" />
<p>“A” represents your knowledge — it’s a subset of all the knowledge in
the cosmos noted by “B”. So if you say by your knowledge there is no
God, God can easily exist anywhere in “B”. Thus your statement is
illogical — no proof is required because the statement itself makes no
sense — it’s a logical absurdity. Naturally, when some atheists find out
the logical absurdity of their position they’ll go to any lengths to
argue against it.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://twitter.com/logantn/status/5026869708">
<p>Using your psuedo-logic, nobody can know anything. Including the fact that we can’t know that we can’t know everything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously that’s wrong. We can know anything in the subset “A”, and the
more we explore, the larger that subset becomes (although it will never
be as large as “B”). Others try the old switch-the-argument fallacy (red
herring); in other words, ignore the problem by trying to change the
discussion to another topic.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://twitter.com/randeazie/status/5025656280">
<p>Atheism is illogical but theism isnt? #fail</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those statements arise from a lack of understanding in logic. Just look
at the diagram above and it’s obvious the statement “There is no God”
assumes you have all knowledge in the cosmos, while “There is a God”
does <em>not</em> make that assumption.</p>
<p>Nobody’s saying you can’t <em>believe</em> there is no God, only if you choose
to make that statement you’re taking it on <em>faith</em>, not reason, critical
thinking, or logic; don’t confuse the logic of the statement with
<em>proof</em>. None of this proves God does or does not exist, only the
atheist claim “There is no God” equates to gibberish — you’re free to
believe nonsense if you wish, but don’t call it reasoned and logical.</p>
<p>Some atheists argue definitions — some have even rejected the
dictionary, substituting their own non-dictionary definition. That’s
their right of course, but doesn’t it make communication difficult if
you don’t agree with the rest of the world the meaning of words? But no
matter — whatever you call it (atheism, dirt, or apple pie), stating
“there is no God” as a (hoped for) fact displays a lack of critical
thinking skills. You can believe nonsense if you wish, but it’s rather
bizarre to call it logical and reasoned.</p>
<p>Other atheists state it’s not an absolute statement (“there is no God”),
only that they’re 99.999% confident no God exists — they’ll leave the
0.001% chance. But how much knowledge do they posses verses exists in
the cosmos? If they’re 99% sure, but only posses 0.00001% (generously)
of all possible knowledge, that doesn’t give their statement much
credibility, does it? Their 99% certainty becomes only 0.0001% (or much
less) when compared to total knowledge; saying they’re 0.0001% sure no
God exists just doesn’t have the same ring to it though, does it?</p>
<p>In other words, they take their atheist dogma on <em>faith</em> — not logic,
reason, and critical thinking. So much for having an open mind.</p>
<p>Yet some might say you can’t say god <em>does</em> exist for the same reason.
But that’s not true; you <em>can</em> say a god exists and be logical because
that statement does not require the person making it to hold all
knowledge for it to be logically sound. But that leads to the
following question.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://twitter.com/Newlady1/status/4376389477">
<p>Stating does exist requires evidence. If I tell you that snoring is caused by a gnome in your nose, I have to support my claim</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That statement <em>is</em> logical, but lacks <em>proof</em>.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
