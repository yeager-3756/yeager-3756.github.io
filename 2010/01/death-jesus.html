<p>This is the crux of the arguments here. It is entirely possible Jesus
never died. The Romans were not doctors after all. Since we cannot
travel back in time with a medical team to certify the death of Jesus,
isn’t it possible He never really died? If there is a chance, then the
resurrection is a hoax, which means Christianity is built on a
deception. Paul teaches if Christ is not risen, then Christian faith
is vain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:
And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith
is also vain. Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we
have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up,
if so be that the dead rise not. <span class="Underline">For if the
dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: And if Christ be not raised,
your faith is vain</span>; ye are yet in your sins. Then they also
which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. (1
Corinthians 15:13-18)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>THE DEFENSE</h2>
<p>To understand whether Jesus really died, we must look at the Roman
method of execution. The following is excerpted from Dr. Mark Eastman’s
(M.D.) medical analysis of crucifixion (Mark Eastman and Chuck Missler
“The Agony of Love: Six hours in eternity” page 18-25), as well as the
preceding events the night before.</p>
<h3>The Flogging</h3>
<p>After his arrest, Jesus was struck about the face by one of the Temple
guard. Then a cover was put on his face and he was further beaten about
the face. Blows to the face such as these would cause severe facial
bruising and cause his eyelids to be swollen almost shut. The result
would have been that he was probably unrecognizable. This was foretold
by Isaiah 700 years before. [Note: even if you doubt when Isaiah wrote
the book that bears his name, remember the Septuagint translation of the
Hebrew Old Testament into Greek occurred about 250 years before Jesus
birth, so this prophecy predates Jesus by at least 250 years. This is
easily verified in any public library - Editor]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and
extolled, and be very high. As many were astonished at thee; his
visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the
sons of men: (Isaiah 52:13-14)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Flogging a victim before he was crucified was the Roman tradition. This
involved a whip with several leather thongs, 18-24 inches long, with
bits of metal, bone or glass embedded in the leather. The prisoner was
usually flogged 39 times (forty minus one was a sign of Roman mercy).</p>
<p>The effects of flogging were staggering. Many people died as a result.
The skin and muscle were shredded and torn from the back. Large volumes
of blood were typically lost.</p>
<h3>The Crucifixion</h3>
<p>Crucifixion was invented by the Persians between 300-400 BC. It was
“perfected” by the Romans in the first century BC. The most common type
of cross in the first century was a low Tau. It consisted of an upright
pole permanently fixed in the ground, called the stipes; And a crossbar
called the patibulum, which usually weighted between 75-100 pounds.</p>
<h3>Fixing the Hands to the Cross</h3>
<p>For centuries, most artists rendered the crucifixion of Jesus with nails
in His hands. However, anatomical studies have shown that this will not
support the weight of an adult male. Archaeological discoveries have
shown that the nails were placed between the radius, ulna, and carpal
bones. By this manner no bones would be broken.</p>
<h3>Fixing the Feet to the Cross</h3>
<p>After flexing the feet into an extreme position the feet were nailed,
usually with one nail, to the stipe, between the second and third
metatarsal bones. The result was that the individual was pinned in place
with the knees bent, bearing full weight on the nails. This was an
incredibly difficult position to maintain due to strain on the thigh
muscles (try to stand with your knees flexed for just five minutes.)</p>
<h3>Physiological Effects of Crucifixion</h3>
<h3>Flogging</h3>
<ul>
<li>Severe dehydration due to blood loss.</li>
<li>Orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure).</li>
<li>Muscle tremors and tetany.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Nailing the Hands</h3>
<ul>
<li>Paralysis of Median Nerve.</li>
<li>Unimaginable pain at first, then paralysis and numbness.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Nailing the Feet</h3>
<ul>
<li>Paralysis of deep peroneal nerve of the feet.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Respiratory effects</h3>
<ul>
<li>Inability to exhale fully.</li>
<li>Hypercarbia (increased carbon dioxide).</li>
<li>Muscle tetany creates a viscous circle. To properly exhale required
lifting the body. Each respiratory effort required so much muscular
effort that muscle fatigue would cause the victim to die
by asphyxia.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cause of death</h3>
<p>The primary cause of death by crucifixion is asphyxiation. That is, the
victim slowly suffocates until dead.</p>
<p>Other contributing factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hypovolemic shock</li>
<li>Exhaustion</li>
<li>Dehydration</li>
<li>Stress induced arrhythmias</li>
<li>Congestive heart failure</li>
<li>Pericardial and pleural effusions</li>
<li>Cardiac rupture.</li>
</ul>
<p>***** End of excerpts from Dr. Mark Eastman *****</p>
<p>It strains credibility to believe someone could survive such an ordeal.
Crucifixion was the most painful, medically disastrous way to die; the
Romans designed it to be cruel. But even if we traveled back in time
with a modern team of doctors, and the most advanced hospital we have,
it is difficult to believe they could have done anything to save Jesus.
A simple study of the medical effects of crucifixion leave no doubt it
was deadly.</p>
<p>The prosecution would have you believe only the Roman soldiers certified
Jesus was dead, so isn’t it likely they could have made a mistake?
Unlikely for two reasons. First, the Romans were experts at crucifixion.
They were not doctors, but they knew how to execute people - they
executed many. And after all, you can’t fake not breathing for very
long; death is difficult to fake. But more importantly is something
about the Romans you may not know. The soldiers performing the execution
had a large stake in being sure the victim was dead. Why? If they made a
mistake, they paid with <em>their</em> life. The penalty for letting a prisoner
escape was the soldier paying the penalty for the prisoner. For a person
condemned to death, the punishment for the soldier would also be death.
You can be sure the soldiers were confident Jesus was dead, after all
they were quite literally betting their life on it. If you were in their
place, wouldn’t you be sure?</p>
<p>Both the medical evidence and the motivation of the Roman soldiers to be
sure Jesus was dead makes it difficult to believe Jesus could have
survived, even if given expert modern medical help the moment he was
removed from the cross.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
