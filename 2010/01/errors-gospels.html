<blockquote>
<p>If I bear witness of Myself, My witness is not true. (John 5:31 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Even if I bear witness of Myself, My witness is true (John 8:14 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both statements cannot be true. The Bible is in error.</p>
<h2>THE DEFENSE</h2>
<p>The Bible has no errors; if the Bible is true, both statements MUST be
true. How can we explain this? Simple. They both <em>are</em> true. Naturally,
skeptics pounce on this as illogical rhetoric in order to claim the
Bible is without errors. How can such apparently opposite statements
be true?</p>
<p>In John 5:31, Jesus says His testimony by itself is not valid. This is
what the law said - by two or more witnesses is testimony confirmed. The
Pharisees are bringing up this point as Jesus speaks; they know what He
said a few chapters earlier. So when Jesus speaks on His own authority,
they pounce on Him as any good skeptic would; He is contradicting
Himself. The modern day skeptic/cynic still jumps on this issue.</p>
<p>We must remember the whole counsel of God; it explains this apparent
problem. If Jesus speaks on His own, His testimony is not valid, as John
5:31 says. How then can His testimony be valid, as He says in chapter
eight? Simple. He <em>doesn’t</em> speak on His own, since Jesus and the Father
are one. Reading just a few verses later in John provides the answer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is true.
I am One who bears witness of Myself, and the Father who sent Me bears
witness of Me.” (John 8:17-18 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I and My Father are one. (John 10:30 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s the trinity that explains how both statements are true. Yes,
according to the law it takes two witnesses to establish the facts;
that’s the point of John 5:31. But since Jesus and the Father are one,
we <em>have</em> two witnesses - separate yet one God. Far from a
contradiction, these two verses show the deity of Jesus and a
confirmation of the trinity. To firmly establish the idea of the
trinity, remember the events during the baptism of Jesus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When He had been baptized, <span class="Underline">Jesus came up
immediately from the water</span>; and behold, the heavens were opened
to Him, and He saw <span class="Underline">the Spirit of God
descending</span> like a dove and alighting upon Him. And suddenly
<span class="Underline">a voice came from heaven, saying, “This is My
beloved Son</span>, in whom I am well pleased.”(Matthew. 3:16-17 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Three distinct persons, yet one God.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one! (Deuteronomy. 6:4)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, <strong>If</strong> Jesus speaks on his own, His testimony is not
valid (John 5:31). But He <strong>doesn’t</strong> speak alone (John 10:30, 8:17-18),
therefore His testimony is valid. (John 8:14).</p>
<h2>THE PROSECUTION</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>So they came to Jerusalem. Then Jesus went into the temple and began
to drive out those who bought and sold in the temple, and overturned
the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold
doves. And He would not allow anyone to carry wares through the
temple. Then He taught, saying to them, “Is it not written, ‘My house
shall be called a house of prayer for all nations’? But you have made
it a ‘den of thieves.’” (Mark 11:15-17 NKJV) (Also Matthew 21:12-13,
Luke 19:45-48)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to
Jerusalem. And He found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep
and doves, and the moneychangers doing business. When He had made a
whip of cords, He drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and
the oxen, and poured out the changers’ money and overturned the
tables. And He said to those who sold doves, “Take these things away!
Do not make My Father’s house a house of merchandise!” Then His
disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for Your house has
eaten Me up.” (John 2:13-17 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Synoptic Gospels (Mathew, Mark and Luke) record this late in the
ministry of Jesus, while John records it early. This is a contradiction
in the chronology of the life of Jesus.</p>
<h2>THE DEFENSE</h2>
<p>So, let’s get this straight. The synoptic Gospels record this event late
in Jesus’ ministry, and John records it early - the prosecution admits
that. But that’s only a problem if you think these are referring to the
same event. But there is no reason to believe they <em>are</em> the same event.
Matthew, Mark and Luke all mention Jesus speaking about a “den of
thieves”, yet John speaks of a “house of merchandise”. And we’ve already
established they are recorded at two different places in Jesus’
ministry. Why would you try and <em>make</em> them the same event? They are not
presented that way.</p>
<p>These are two different events, and are presented as such in the Gospel
accounts. You must force these to be the same event (in spite of
evidence to the contrary) in order to fabricate a contradiction. But
just reading the four accounts shows they are NOT presented as the same
event, and there is no logical reason to believe they <em>are</em> the
same event.</p>
<p>But as we shall see, this is a common tactic of the prosecution -
forcing things into the text that aren’t there (as well as omitting
things when convenient).</p>
<h2>THE PROSECUTION</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Now after the Sabbath, as the first day of the week <span
class="Underline">began to dawn</span>, Mary Magdalene and the other
Mary came to see the tomb. (Matthew 28:1 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="Underline">Very early in the morning</span>, on the first
day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen. (Mark
16:2 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now on the first day of the week, <span class="Underline">very early
in the morning</span>, they, and certain other women with them, came
to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared. (Luke 24:1)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene went to the tomb
early, <span class="Underline">while it was still dark</span>, and saw
that the stone had been taken away from the tomb. (John 20:1 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When did they go to the tomb? Was it “at dawn” or “Very early in the
morning” or “while it was still dark”?</p>
<h2>THE DEFENSE</h2>
<p>As they saying goes, “six of one, half a dozen of the other”. All these
words mean the same thing (just expressed differently) and refer to the
same period of time. As the day dawns, it’s dark, and also very early in
the morning - nobody would dispute that. It takes considerable
imagination to conjure up a contradiction here.</p>
<p>The skeptic/cynic has to reach to believe this is a contradiction - all
the terms used refer to the same part of the day, just as 50 cents, 2
quarters and 5 dimes refer to the same amount of money.</p>
<h2>THE PROSECUTION</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Now after the Sabbath, as the first day of the week began to dawn,
Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb. (Matthew
28:1 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of
James, and Salome bought spices, that they might come and anoint Him.
(Mark 16:1 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they, and
certain other women with them, came to the tomb bringing the spices
which they had prepared. (Luke 24:1 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene went to the tomb
early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken
away from the tomb. (John 20:1 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who went to the tomb? Was it Mary and Mary (Matthew), Mary, Mary and
Salome (Mark), or Mary Magdalene alone (John)?</p>
<h2>THE DEFENSE</h2>
<p>This is another case of reading into the text what is not there - by
forcing each writer to say this was a complete list of the people who
went to the tomb. But no Gospel writer claims that. Let’s put them
together and see what comes of this “error”.</p>
<ul>
<li>Matthew - Mary Magdalene and the other Mary</li>
<li>Mark - Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome</li>
<li>Luke - unspecified - in previous verses, the “they” is referred to
as “women who had come with Him from Galilee” (Luke 23:55)</li>
<li>John - Mary Magdalene</li>
</ul>
<p>Put them all together and we get Mary Magdalene, the other Mary, Mary
the mother of James, Salome, and “women come from Galilee”. Take this
list and go back through all accounts to see if there really is
a contradiction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Matthew - no error. He doesn’t mention Salome, but it’s not a
problem for he never said ONLY those two went to the tomb.</li>
<li>Mark - Mark presents the most complete list, so there is no problem.</li>
<li>Luke - “women from Galilee” - Certainly all the names are women, so
no problem here.</li>
<li>John - Just like Matthew, he doesn’t give an entire list, but there
is no problem since he doesn’t say ONLY Mary Magdalene. John is
emphasizing Mary for a particular reason found later in the chapter;
the fact he omits the others is because he is focusing on a
particular event between Mary Magdalene and Jesus.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is another case of an imagined error. Just reading the text and
taking it at what it says you realize there is no error. It’s only a
problem if you read something that isn’t there (that each writer claims
his list is the complete and exclusive list). Actually, all four writers
are in agreement.</p>
<h2>THE PROSECUTION</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Now it came to pass, about <span class="Underline">eight days</span>
after these sayings, that He took Peter, John, and James and went up
on the mountain to pray. (Luke 9:28)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now <span class="Underline">after six days</span> Jesus took Peter,
James, and John his brother, led them up on a high mountain by
themselves; (Matthew 17:1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Was this six days or eight days?</p>
<h2>THE DEFENSE</h2>
<p>Here is a case of the skeptic/cynic conveniently <em>leaving out</em> part of
the text in order to find an error in the Bible. But read carefully.
Luke says “<strong>about</strong> eight days”. Matthew says “after six days”. After
six days is at least seven days, or about eight days. Luke adds the
phrase “after these sayings” and likely is referring to teaching given
by Jesus over several days.</p>
<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>In these so-called “errors”, we notice three errors made frequently in
order to claim contradictions in the Bible:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="Underline">Errors in theology</span>. Certainly, we
shouldn’t expect a non-Christian to understand the finer points of
theology anymore than we would expect Einstein to explain quantum
mechanics to a 5 year old. Nevertheless, an open-minded person
should be able to understand some theology - even if they don’t
accept it.</li>
<li><span class="Underline">Reading into the text</span> beyond what the
text says. God says what He means and means what He says. Don’t add
claims the writers of the Gospels didn’t say.</li>
<li><span class="Underline">Ignoring parts of the text</span>. This can
happen either overtly by ignoring a word, or ignoring other passages
or facts that illuminate the point in question.</li>
</ol>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
