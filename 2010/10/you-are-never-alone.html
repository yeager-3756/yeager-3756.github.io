  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Last week a tragic event occurred as a person was struck and killed by a
train. As it turns out, video from the train (no, I don’t think—and
hope—it’s not public) revealed the person walked to the middle of the
tracks, closed their eyes, and waited to be hit.</p>
<p>Suicide by locomotive.</p>
<p>Depression and desperation caused this person to end their life.
Everyone at some point feels alone and troubled (that’s part of the
human condition), yet not everyone feels the need to invoke a permanent
solution to a temporary problem. Why?</p>
<p>We’ve received mail from people feeling hopeless, God hates them, and
they’ll just give up. We respond urging them to get counsel from
pastors, friends, or someone else they trust, because at the lowest of
the lows, frequently the common emotion remains simple — “I’m
all alone”.</p>
<p>We certainly can’t solve the world’s problems (and won’t even try), but
one thing we’ve learned over the years is one simple truth:</p>
<p><strong>You are not alone.</strong></p>
<p>Oh sure, it may (likely does) <em>feel</em> like that, but it’s not true.</p>
<p>Poor Job, here was a guy with everything going for him, and one day (due
to a conversation between God and Satan he was unaware of) he gets
blasted, losing everything. Even his wife advised him to curse God
and die.</p>
<p>When his “friends” show up, they tell him he’s somehow messed up (not
true), or in other words, he’s all alone.</p>
<p>Elijah certainly suffered from depression; after the high point of Mt.
Carmel and defeating the prophets of Baal, what happens in the next
chapter? The queen has it out for him, and he becomes depressed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children
of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and
slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and
they seek my life, to take it away (1 Kings 19:10).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What was his problem? He bought the lie he was all alone. Hiding,
depressed, and feeling all alone, the Lord responds to Elijah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet I have reserved seven thousand in Israel (1 Kings 19:18 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To paraphrase God’s response:</p>
<p><strong>You are not alone.</strong></p>
<p>Even the giant of the New Testament — the apostle Paul — struggled with
problems, at one point proclaiming:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For we do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, of our trouble which
came to us in Asia: that we were burdened beyond measure, above
strength, so that we despaired even of life (2 Corinthians 1:8 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul? Despaired of life? Burdened beyond measure? Beyond strength?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p><strong>You are not alone.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, sometimes it feels like it, but you’re not. If you have feelings of
hopelessness and despair, do one more thing before giving up: reach out
(in person) to a friend, counselor, pastor, or someone else you trust.
Sure, you think it won’t work, sure you might believe it’s a waste of
your time, definitely they won’t understand what you’re going through.</p>
<p>Do it anyway.</p>
<p>After all, if you’re right, will tomorrow differ from today? That same
black cloud still looms overhead waiting for you — you’ve lost nothing.
Yet if you’re wrong, tomorrow could be <em>quite</em> different from today.</p>
<p>Don’t accept permanent solutions to problems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh. Is there anything too
hard for Me? (Jeremiah 32:27 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
