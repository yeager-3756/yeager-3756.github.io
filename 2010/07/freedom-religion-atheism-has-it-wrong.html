  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Freedom of religion makes the news quite a bit as atheists attempt to
stomp out any and all references to God frequently claiming “separation
of church and state” as meaning a valedictorian can’t mention God in
their commencement speech, or nativity scenes can’t exist in public
places, or crosses on hills, or any public display of religion anywhere.</p>
<p>It’s important to understand that opinion only recently came to light;
from the inception of the country until recently, the original intent,
meaning, and application were quite different. And if anyone knew what
the Founders intended, it was the men who wrote it; by studying the
early application a picture becomes clear of what the Constitution
intended for freedom of religion.</p>
<p>First off, it’s freedom <em>to</em> religion, not freedom <em>from</em>; atheists have
it wrong. But how many of them have actually <em>read</em> the first amendment
and understand the history?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of
speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to
assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simply reading it, two obvious points can’t be missed:</p>
<ol>
<li>It concerns Government—specifically Congress.</li>
<li>It states Congress shall not pass <em>law</em> establishing religion. In
other words, a national church.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you just read the Constitution, you’d <em>never</em> arrive at the absurd
conclusion a student couldn’t mention God in their speech, or a state
could not have prayer before convening the legislature. Simply put, it’s
a restriction on <em>legislation</em> of the <em>Federal</em> government <strong>only</strong>
(14th amendment issues included, it still only applies to <em>legislation</em>,
and certainly can’t apply to private citizens).</p>
<p>So how does “Congress” morph into “private citizen”, and “law” change
into “any expression” when that clearly isn’t what it says? The
prohibition involves <em>law</em> (legislation) only, not expressions, as
freedom of religious expression is specifically mentioned <em>not</em> to be
prohibited. God in speeches? Fine. Prayer before legislature?
Acceptable. Crosses in cemeteries or memorials? Perfectly legitimate.
<em>None</em> of those are law establishing a national religion, rather they’re
free exercises of religion.</p>
<p>More importantly, would any lawyer or judge with an IQ above single
digits arrive at a conclusion the Founders really meant “citizen” when
they wrote “Congress”, or “law” really means “expression”? The atheist
version of the first amendment reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No person shall have any expression of religion in public, and it’s
acceptable to prohibit the free exercise thereof…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Turning “Congress” into “citizen” and “law” into “expression” provides
the very definition of judicial activism — judges making up what the law
clearly doesn’t say. Worse yet, in this case, it’s obvious the Founders
(and the Supreme Court until the 1940’s) most definitely would <em>not</em>
agree with the “no religion allowed” view of it; that opinion is a
relatively recent idea; even in 1952 the Supreme Court acknowledged the
founding of United States on religious principles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme
Being. … When the state encourages religious instruction or cooperates
with religious authorities by adjusting the schedule of public events
to sectarian needs, it follows the best of our traditions. For it then
respects the religious nature of our people and accommodates the
public service to their spiritual needs. To hold that it may not would
be to find in the Constitution a requirement that the government show
a callous indifference to religious groups. That would be preferring
those who believe in no religion over those who do believe.<br />
<cite>Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U. S. 306 (1952)</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s absurd and laughable when some groups attempt to <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/04/first-amendment-separation-church-state.html">deny the country’s religious foundation</a>.
That can only come from someone who hasn’t studied history, or attempts
to rewrite it to suit their view. Even <a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/church-state/decisions.html">atheist groups</a>
begin their Supreme Court history on this subject in 1948, simply
because it’s a recent opinion.</p>
<p>How the activist interpretation became popular provides an interesting
story, but for now understand it’s a very recent theory, beginning in
the 1940’s and culminating in the 1960’s to provide the current model of
open hostility to religion.</p>
<p>But that’s not what the Founders intended, as even a casual glance at
both the Founders, and history until the 1940’s proves
abundantly obvious.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
