<p>Captain, we’re drifting into dangerous waters! All hands on deck! Sound
the alarm!</p>
<p>Perhaps nothing differentiates “modern” (read that: liberal) and
traditional Christianity more than the role of men and women. Those
promoting a modern social justice version discard parts of the Bible not
fitting their position, frequently by arguing those parts have
historical meaning only. Does that make sense? Can we pick and choose
what is God’s Word and what isn’t? If so, <em>how</em> can that be done, and
<em>who</em> gets to make the rules (since it isn’t God)?</p>
<p>Those minefields present themselves to the social justice liberal
redefining Christianity in their image (only using parts of the Bible)
instead of God’s.</p>
<p>The traditional view the church held for almost 2,000 years was women
could not hold one position in church: senior pastor; discarding
orthodox theology only recently developed. One recent article by Sara
VanScoy appeared in Sojourners magazine (the magazine of Jim Wallis
promoting the social justice version of Christianity).</p>
<blockquote cite="http://blog.sojo.net/2010/06/30/patriarchy-in-the-church-and-its-effects/">
<p>The prophet Joel said that when the Spirit comes, sons and daughters would prophesy (that is, preach).  … Any sort of gender ordering is the result of fallen humanity.  When churches regard women as second-class citizens, they are espousing an ideology that is less than God’s ideal!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, prophesying and preaching (teaching) aren’t the same thing.
Second, Paul in 1 Corinthians 11:5 already mentions women prophesying in
the church, so Joel and Paul don’t have any disagreement between them.
Third she claims women as second-class citizens, an idea with no
Biblical support. Where in the Bible did it say women are second-class?
She’s arguing against something which doesn’t exist (at least in
the Bible).</p>
<p>The problem with “modern” (we’d say corrupt) social justice theology
remains quite simple — unequal does <em>not</em> imply inferior; a common
mistake stems from the difference between “A” and “B” means either “A”
is inferior to “B” or “B” is inferior to “A”. Not so; difference and/or
inequality does <em>not</em> mean inferior.</p>
<p>Men and women are not equal, yet <em>that does not imply one is inferior</em>.
Ms. VanScoy made the basic mistake that anything not the same means one
must be superior over other. That’s illogical (and quite wrong). Is an
apple superior to a carrot? Of course not, they have different uses in
the body, and it’s the differences that makes both fruit <em>and</em>
vegetables required.</p>
<p>Men and women differ not from the carrot and the apple (we’ll leave it
to the reader to determine which relates to which). In the body of
Christ, <em>both</em> are required, and <em>both</em> differ in their strengths and
weaknesses. But that does not mean all roles can be performed by each,
just as if your physical body has scurvy (a disease from lack of vitamin
C), you’ll require an orange much more than a carrot.</p>
<p>Ah ha! Using Ms. VanScoy’s logic, that means the carrot is inferior! A
second-class food! Why oh why are carrots so maligned?</p>
<p>See how absurd modern liberal logic is?</p>
<p>Once you decide to ignore portions of the Bible, you’ve got to figure
out <em>who’s</em> going to determine what should be followed, and <em>what</em>
should be ignored. Of course, she’s already saying she’ll accept <em>some</em>
of the Bible, while rejecting other parts. Why? Who gets to make that
determination? What makes her choice of what applies today and what
doesn’t better than anyone else’s? Her position holds nothing more than
value relativism (meaning no absolutes exist, just whatever you feel
like at the moment).</p>
<p>As some boldly proclaim they know what parts of the Bible apply today
and what don’t, they’ve placed themselves in the position they rally
against — those claiming superiority in the church. Naturally, they miss
the irony of their position.</p>
<p>In another article on Sojourners, Anne Eggebroten continues the
I’ll-ignore-what-I-don’t-like thought as well.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.sojo.net/index.cfm?action=magazine.article&amp;issue=soj1007&amp;article=the-persistence-of-patriarchy">
<p>To conclude that women should be silent and not hold office in the church … you must ignore evidence that the “pastoral epistles” (1 and 2 Timothy and Titus) were written in honor of Paul long after he died and reflect a second-century debate over women’s roles in the church…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How convenient! By ignoring those letters, you ignore Paul’s statement
“<em>All</em> scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for
doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness
(2 Timothy 3:16)”. Thus, now you’re free to pick and choose whatever
you want.</p>
<p>Hurry Hurry hurry, step right up and don’t be late, you can now create
your own designer religion! Just pick the parts of the Bible you like,
and discard parts you don’t! Now we can create sects like:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Swingers Bible — just ignore all those pesky parts on adultery.
While you’re at it, get rid of all the marriage stuff, it’s
so confining!</li>
<li>Bill and Ted’s Bible — delete all the warnings on drugs. Excellent!
Party on dude!</li>
</ul>
<p>But wait, there’s more! If you change your mind later, just change the
rules. We don’t want to be tied down to any interpretation, be flexible!
It’s all a cultural thing, you know.</p>
<p>Wait a minute, someone will say, you can’t just cast aside verses you
don’t like just because you want to cheat on your wife and use drugs.</p>
<p>Exactly. So why do people do it to support <em>their</em> agenda? If they can
ignore verses they don’t like, anyone else can ignore verses supporting
any view. Thus, it quickly degenerates into a designer religion as each
person makes up whatever they want.</p>
<p>Do you think God would approve of that?</p>
<p>Frequently these argue against something the Bible doesn’t promote. The
Bible doesn’t say women should be slaves. The Bible doesn’t say women
should stay in an abusive relationship. The Bible doesn’t say women are
inferior. The Bible doesn’t say women can’t serve in the church.</p>
<p>These people fight against something which doesn’t exist (at least in
the Bible, if a church holds those ideas, that’s another matter).</p>
<p>OK, so what <em>is</em> the proper relationship?</p>
<p>Once you understand you’re in a spiritual war, and the army of God has a
particular order in it (or should), these problems with inferiority
disappear. It’s not a question of holding someone down, or placing them
as second-class citizens, rather it’s regarding military order.</p>
<p>Paul states one area off-limits to women; we’ll quote our book beginning
with the passage that frequently begins the problem (it’s likely one
verse not included in the modern liberal cut-and-paste Bible anyway).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and
the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. (1 Corinthians 11:3)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul begins navigating yet another mineﬁeld — what about men and women
and proper roles in the church? Again, the Corinthian church experienced
problems in this area, and those problems remain today; Paul’s teaching
remains as relevant today as it was in the ﬁrst century AD. […]</p>
<p>First off, if you don’t know men and women aren’t equal you need a
biology lesson. Seriously. Let that sink in a bit, and be sure you’re
convinced of the absolute truth before continuing. For example, in
general, men possess more strength than women. That means if I take a
statistically valid sample, the men will outperform the women as a
group. It does <em>not</em> mean you can’t ﬁnd <em>a</em> woman who will be stronger
than <em>a</em> man. Men and women are not equal — but that doesn’t imply
superiority or inferiority, and it’s a mistake to make it so; be sure
you understand inequality does not imply inferiority.</p>
<p>One view of this passage prohibits women from being involved in the
church in an active role. Of course, that makes no sense as Paul
mentions women prophesying and speaking in verse ﬁve, and that
necessarily means women <em>do</em> prophecy and speak in church. Remember the
theme of the chapter — military order. Only one job Paul states clearly
women are not to have in the church, as he told Timothy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I permit not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the
man, but to be in silence. (1 Timothy 2:12)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That verse causes big problems as well — does it apply today? Or is it
just a cultural argument for Paul’s time? How can you ﬁnd out? Common
sense — examine <em>why</em> Paul says that in the next few verses. Remember,
don’t confuse the principle with the argument supporting it. The
principle in verse 12 restricts women from holding the ofﬁce of
leadership — pastors.</p>
<p>It might be <em>popular</em> to allow women pastors today, but it’s not
<em>Biblical</em>. Those ignoring Paul’s principle in verse 12 claim it was
only a historical and cultural issue which doesn’t remain today. Oh
really? Those groups haven’t done their homework as they blindly cast
off Paul’s principle, without considering how Paul supported his
principle in the next two verses to Timothy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For Adam was ﬁrst formed, then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but the
woman being deceived was in the transgression. (1 Timothy 2:13–14)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul’s support for verse 12 comes from <em>history</em>, and unless history
changes (hint: it can’t) his point stands for all time. Thus, the
restriction applies today. If you want to create your own designer
religion which conﬂicts with the Bible you’re free to do so. But since
Paul’s support comes from unchanging history, it’s ludicrous to claim
the principle doesn’t apply today, for it surely does. Don’t shoot the
messenger, it’s Paul writing God’s Word so you should take it up
with them.</p>
<p>Paul’s discussion remains valid for all time as the validation for it
comes from unchanging history, not changing cultural values. Does that
mean women are second-class citizens? Of course not. Those attempting
such foolishness remain in error as much as those claiming the passage
doesn’t apply. <cite><em>The Troubled Church</em>, page 119,121–123 ISBN
978-0-9831117-0-2</cite></p>
<p>For more, get the book on 1 Corinthians to examine Paul’s letter, as
well as the MP3’s for free on the web.</p>
<p>In the end you’ve got a choice, accept the Bible, or pick and choose
whatever you want, creating your own religion in the process. That path
leads to much fighting as everyone disagrees on what from the Bible must
be applied, and what can be ignored, harking back to the time of Judges
where everyone did what was right in their own eyes.</p>
<p>You’re free to create whatever religion you wish, but don’t call it
Christianity as it has no relationship to Christianity at all.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
