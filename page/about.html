  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Why We’re Here</h2>
<p>To discuss the Bible, politics, science, and religion — not simply
reporting news, but how it fits together to affect your life. We’ll
frequently refer to a 3AM phone call — you might remember Hillary
Clinton’s political ad.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s 3AM and your children are safe and asleep. But there’s a phone in
the White House and it’s ringing. Something’s happening in the world …
who do you want answering the phone?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How does a political ad relate to your Christian life? At 3AM you don’t
have anyone to lean on. Are you prepared? Or <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/09/matrix-guide-christianity.html">living in The Matrix</a>?
We present a collection of resources on the Bible, Christian living,
politics, atheism, and science, differing from other blogs in a few
ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>The majority of content relates to a simple question: <strong>Will <em>you</em>
be ready to answer the call at 3AM?</strong> Because at 3AM you’ve got what
you’ve got.</li>
<li>While we <em>do</em> cover some current events, <strong>it’s not a news site, but
rather how events relate to your life</strong>, Bible prophecy, and the
future.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t expect large volume of posts</strong>. 4–6 per month is a normal
frequency. We’re more interested in <em>how</em> news and science relates
to you than simply reporting what you already hear from dozens of
other sources.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Who Cares About That?</h2>
<p>Well, <em>you</em> should.</p>
<p>Too many Christians face trials and crisis, and when they look in their
toolbox for something to use, they find nothing. We want to change that.</p>
<p><strong>Our goal is to make this your go-to reference for filling your
toolbox.</strong> Because you <em>will</em> have those 3AM moments, the only question
will be how you handle them.</p>
<p>Filling your toolbox requires Bible knowledge, but also science, logic,
and attitude, and Christians must transition from beginner to
black-belt. It’s time to <strong>get off the sideline, and get in the game</strong>.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Where's the print button?</dt>
<dd>The site is designed for printing. No need for a special print
    button, if you’re using any modern browser (Firefox, Opera, Chrome,
    Safari, Konqueror, IE9+) pages should print fine. You’ll also notice
    if you have Javascript enabled all links and references used will
    print at the end in an “Endnotes” section.</dd>
<dt>I have a Bible question, will you answer it?</dt>
<dd>Absolutely!</dd>
<dt>Can I share printed copies of the articles?</dt>
<dd>Sure — while the content is copyrighted you may share it with
    friends and family provided you don’t sell it, don’t claim it as
    your own, don’t modify it, and attribute it correctly. Naturally, if
    we find it available on the Internet, that’s not only a violation of
    copyright (and not very Christian), it’s illegal as well.</dd>
<dt>Are you available for speaking engagements or guest blogging?</dt>
<dd>Absolutely! See the above headings for freelance writing or guest speaking.</dd>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
