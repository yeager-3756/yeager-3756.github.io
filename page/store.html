<h2>Stay In the Game … but you still don’t get a pony</h2>
<p>A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! But everyone needs help sometimes.</p>
<p>A simple, but difficult, cure comes from a stiff shot of reality — God is not a genie granting wishes, life is hard, and you  may not get a pony. If you’re not resting, it’s time to take a good look at the letter to the Hebrews, as Paul provides warning after warning about the minefield you must pass through. Paul motivates the troops to not abandon what they know to be true, and stay in the game, even when (not if) adversity strikes.</p>
<p>When tough times come, you’ll look down in your toolbox and discover either many tools to fight with, or a mocking echo from the empty box, because at 3am you’ve got what you’ve got.</p>

<h2>Get Back in the Game</h2>
<p>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. It’s time to get back in the game, because preparedness only comes from training and effort. </p>
<p>The failure to prepare isn’t a new trend, as Israel faced a similar problem. After one of their captivities, a few decided to return to the Holy Land to build the temple. Naturally, enemies began to attack, and the builders withered, gave up, and quit. The battle’s too hard, we’re tired, let someone else do it, it’s not the right time, and so on, as they rationalized excuses for quitting.</p>
<p>It’s the same problem Christians face today, so we’ll require the same solution Israel did, as Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can still use today. It’s time to do something, transforming from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned and combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

<h2>The Troubled Church</h2>
<p>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over.</p>
<p>Have you considered how people outside the church view these distractions? Have you talked to someone who refuses to enter church again due to the actions of Christians? If Christians should be “little Christs” in their actions, this response reveals much about the state of the church — and it’s not good. When considered in that light, both the problems in Corinth as well as Paul’s correction take on new importance, demanding new focus from a fresh study.</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>
