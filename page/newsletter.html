  <header><h1>It’s 2:59AM … Are You Ready For 3AM?</h1></header>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>
<p><strong>It’s 3AM and your children are safe and asleep. But there’s a phone
in the White House and it’s ringing. Something’s happening in the
world … who do you want answering the phone?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hillary’s famous political ad made the point she had executive
experience and could handle emergency events herself, while her rival
Obama had no executive experience … and <strong>at 3AM when a crisis arises,
advisers aren’t around to lean on.</strong></p>
<p>So what does a political ad have to do with your Christian life?</p>
<p><em>You</em> will answer the phone, not your pastor or friends.</p>
<p><strong>Are <em>you</em> prepared at 3AM</strong> when nobody is around? At 3AM, you’ve got
what you’ve got. If you’re depending on the availability of your pastor,
friends, or even your husband or wife, you could be in for a <em>big</em>
surprise when crunch time arrives.</p>
<h2>Who Cares About That?</h2>
<p>Well, <em>you</em> should.</p>
<p>Too many Christians face trials and crisis, and when they look in their
toolbox for something to use, they find nothing. We want to change that.</p>
<p><strong>Our goal is be your go-to reference for filling your toolbox.</strong>
Because you <em>will</em> have those 3AM moments, the only question will be how
you handle them.</p>
<p>You can fight like Chuck Norris, or be slaughtered like a pig. It’s your
choice. But be assured, no other options exist.</p>
<p>We don’t want to be your 3AM resource, we want <strong>you</strong> to be equipped to
pick up the phone.</p>
<p>Filling your toolbox requires Bible knowledge, but also science, logic,
and attitude. Christians must transition from beginner to black-belt if
they want to handle the 3AM phone call. It’s time to <strong>get off the
sideline, and get in the game</strong>.</p>
<p>Members receive a free chapter from <em>“Stay in the Game, but you still
don’t get a pony”</em> and updates of new articles.</p>
<p>This is a low-volume list, so don’t worry about being flooded with
messages. Typically we send out 1–3 messages per week. We won’t sell
your information.</p>
<p><strong>A dog, a horse, and Superman walk into a bar…</strong> Not a joke, it’s an
article I wrote titled “Animal Magnetism” which you can only get by
signing up — and I actually wrote at 3AM. Sign up now!</p>
<p><strong>At 3AM you’ve got what you’ve got</strong> … and it’s 2:59AM so sign up now
and start filling up your toolbox.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
