    <dd><p>When a major shift in society occurs (some law or court decision) people ask: “How will this change the way you teach the Bible?” The answer isn’t hard, but the reason behind it is complex, but it’s something which reveals the key between God and Government.</p></dd>

    <dd><p>People worry about Christians being persecuted. But the church is never hurt by persecution. However, a huge danger does exist which can destroy the church, and you must be aware of it. It's not the Supreme Court, legislation, or even new laws.</p></dd>

    <dd><p>Doublethink as defined by Orwell is defined as the ability to hold conflicting ideas and accept both of them. As absurd as that sounds, it frequently occurs, and is something to be avoided.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2013/06/truth-isnt-relative.html">Truth Isn’t Relative</a></dt>

    <dd><p>Orwell’s “1984” probably isn’t on too many High School reading lists anymore, for the simple reason it’s too close to reality — a future where “news” is edited to fit official narratives, massive government surveillance exists, after-birth abortion, and if you recall “Logan’s Run”, when your usefulness runs out, your life ends as well (at the hands of the government).</p></dd>

    <dd><p>Not much ever changes — human behavior remains basically the same over thousands of years. Sure we give it different names and labels, but underlying behavior doesn’t change much. Thus, when Jesus walked the earth we’d expect to see Him encounter groups similar to groups today.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/03/after-birth-abortion.html">After Birth Abortion</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Abortion will always remain a hot-button topic because it isn’t possible to craft a compromise. You either terminate a pregnancy or you don’t. No middle ground can exist. However, the “Journal of Medical Ethics” came up with A Modest Proposal concerning babies with Down’s syndrome or other problems.</p></dd>

    <dd><p>Christians will soon have to make a choice: follow the phony reality of The Matrix, or stand on the rock of God’s Word. Unfortunately, those calling for Christians to accept man’s philosophy miss an important point: man’s best ideas continually change — remember when using leaches was considered good medicine?</p></dd>

In this incident, we’ll draw some conclusions about the legal system — good or bad — instead of continuing other discussion you’ll find elsewhere.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/06/atheists-unhinged.html">Atheists Unhinged</a></dt>
    <dd><p>New York wants to memorialize seven firefighters who died on 9/11 (a good thing) by renaming a street “Seven in Heaven Way.” Who could have a problem with that? Enter stage left, atheists trying to stamp out all religion based on their illogical and unprovable dogma. Where’s the tolerance?</p></dd>

    <dd><p>Recently a storm erupted regarding the change in phrasing from “freedom of religion”, to “freedom to worship”. As the administration’s comments and speeches are vetted and approved in advance (and usually read from a prompter), it’s not simply a slip of the tongue but an intended policy change.</p></dd>

    <dd><p>We’ve referred to doublethink several times, but many have asked what exactly it consists of. Surely it doesn’t really exist, as Orwell wrote a fictionalized account of a future government in “1984”. No, it really exists…</p></dd>

    <dd><p>Didactic versus dialectic isn't an abstract debate. It affects you in everyday conversation. Ever wonder why some people won't hold to normal definitions? They're likely recently educated in government schools, and haven't been taught how to think clearly and logically.</p></dd>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
