    <h1>Liberal Theology Begins with Denying the Bible</h1>

  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Last week we discussed Walter Martin noticing <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/06/the-cult-of-liberal-theology.html">The Cult of Liberal Theology</a>
(modern, liberal, progressive, social justice, etc) begins with an
incorrect view of the Bible. If you come from a traditional, orthodox
Christian background you might not have seen how <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/06/didactic-dialectic-thought.html">dialectic thought</a>
can claim to accept the Bible as the Word of God, all while denying it.</p>
<p>Sound bizarre? Here’s an example from a discussion about a (supposed)
controversial passage (the passage itself isn’t the issue here, rather
the basic view of the Bible).</p>
<blockquote cite="http://rachelheldevans.com/mutuality-let-women-speak">
<p><i><b><u>The epistles were never meant to be interpreted and applied as universal law.</u></b></i> <b>Rather, they provide us with an instructive and inspired glimpse into how Jesus’ teachings were lived out by <i><u>real</u></i> people, in <i><u>real</u></i> communities, facing <i><u>real</u></i> challenges. It is not the details found in the letters that we should seek to imitate, but rather the attitudes</b>. The details (head coverings, circumcision, meat offered to idols, widow management, hair length, etc.) are rarely timeless, but the attitudes (<i>“as much as it depends on you, live peaceably with all men,” “do not cause your brother to stumble,” “avoid the appearance of evil”</i>) provide guidelines that can instruct us as Christians today. … (emphasis in original — underline as italic)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What? The New Testament isn’t meant to be applied universally? Perhaps
they missed this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for
doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
righteousness (2 Timothy 3:16)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All in Greek is πᾶς (Strongs 3956) meaning … well … all — the same as in
Matthew “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by <strong>every</strong> word that
proceedeth out of the mouth of God.”</p>
<p>Liberal make-up-your-own theology changes what Paul wrote to “the parts
of the Bible agreeing with my predetermined ideology is inspired by God
and useful. The rest we’ll ignore.”</p>
<p>Yet all means all, that’s all all means. All is inspired by God, all is
useful — yet liberals say it only “provides guidelines” or parts don’t
apply today, or what Paul said isn’t really what he meant.</p>
<p>Either Paul is correct, or liberal theology is. They can’t both be
correct since they’re contradictory, or as Peter spoke of Paul:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of his comments are hard to understand, and those who are
ignorant and unstable have twisted his letters to mean something quite
different, just as they do with other parts of Scripture. And this
will result in their destruction. (2 Peter 3:16 NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>IF</em> the Bible is the inspired Word of God, Paul is correct to Timothy —
it’s <em>all</em> God’s Word, and <em>all</em> applicable. Yes, some issues like
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/03/do-serious-christians-have-to-follow-mosaic-law.html">Christians following Mosiac Law</a>
require theology to fully understand, and sometimes the Bible uses
figures of speech, but those are generally obvious — as obvious as
reading the newspaper or a novel where such usage is clear.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the Bible remains clear and obvious. If it says
one-third of grass will be burned up, it means that. When Paul spoke of
qualifications for elders, he meant it. When he gave instruction, it
wasn’t an allegory.</p>
<p>You’re free to accept or reject it as you wish, but liberals look rather
silly claiming to accept the Bible as the Word of God … while rejecting
it at the same time (what Orwell called DoubleThink), revealing their
foundational principle … the Bible is <em>not</em> all useful and <em>not</em> all the
Word of God, thus only parts apply (and strangely they’re qualified to
tell you which is which).</p>
<p>The question for liberal modern-theology progressive post-modern
proponents — <em>who</em> gets to choose what applies, <em>how</em> are they going to
do that, and <em>why</em> is their idea of what doesn’t apply today better than
others?</p>
<p>Liberals don’t have answers to those questions, yet boldly proclaim we
should follow their contradictory and illogical ideology by fiat,
instead of God’s Word.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what you call it — modern theology, liberal,
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/11/post-modern-philosophy-church.html">post-modern</a>,
progressive, emerging, new-fangled, or whatever the
buzzword-of-the-month is — it all starts with denying the Bible as the
inspired, inerrant Word of God.</p>
<p>And that’s not a good place to begin from, because at 3AM, you’ve got
what you’ve got — and what you require is the absolute Word of God, not
philosophy wondering if God really meant what Paul wrote (hint: He did).</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
