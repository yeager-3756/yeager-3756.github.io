  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Listening to an old Walter Martin message titled “The Cult of
Liberalism” and his warning applies more today than when he spoke over
20 years ago. I wonder what he would think of today’s repackaged failed
liberal theology of the past. As Solomon said, there’s nothing new under
the sun — just previous un-Biblical ideas wrapped in new terminology and
sold to unsuspecting victims.</p>
<p>One idea Martin presented was how all these corruptions <em>begin</em> — with a
corrupt view of the Bible as something <em>other</em> than God’s infallible,
inerrant Word. The Bible does not <em>contain</em> the Word of God, it <em>is</em> the
Word of God; a mountain of meaning exists between those two ideas.</p>
<p>Liberals and progressives always begin with the premise only parts of
the Bible apply — and they’re the only ones qualified to tell you which
parts apply and which don’t.</p>
<p>Qualifications for elders? Chuck that one. Sexual perversion? We’ll keep
some, and chuck some. Rules on adultery? We’ll keep those … for now.
Marriage? That’s “evolving” so who knows tomorrow?</p>
<p>Once the liberals begin to chop up the Bible, how do you know anything?
You don’t. You have a form of Christianity, while denying all that makes
Christianity Christian.</p>
<p>Why do they do this? Simply put, rebellion. They want to <em>look</em> like
Christians while living any way they wish, or as Paul told Timothy they
would have a form of godliness, but deny the power thereof.</p>
<p>Many people recognize heretics when they’re wild-eyed on TV, but not
when liberalism infests the church. Liberals may use the same terms, but
anybody even casually reading Paul’s letters knows social justice has
<em>nothing</em> to do with the gospel, as Paul exactly defines the Gospel in 1
Corinthians 15.</p>
<p>Anyone believing social justice is the heart of the gospel is either
wildly uniformed (or hasn’t read the Bible), or for some reason wants to
deceive you into believing something not existing in the text.</p>
<p>Test <em>everything</em> against the Bible, and when someone slithers up to you
speaking of social justice and the Gospel, ask them <em>where</em> that appears
anywhere in the New Testament.</p>
<p>… and you’ll be met with a deer-in-the-headlights look, because they
<em>know</em> it’s not there.</p>
<p>You have an <em>individual</em> mandate to help those in need (and we’ll leave
the definition of needy undefined), but nowhere in the New Testament
does Jesus or any apostle tell you the church should abandon its mission
and lobby government to seize assets from one group to give to another
(social justice).</p>
<p>Social justice remains a godless extreme political ideology, not a
Christian one.</p>
<p>Only <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/11/post-modern-philosophy-church.html">post-modern liberal, progressive theology</a> could
make such an association. It’s sure not in the text.</p>
<p>A fun idea when you encounter those in <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/10/tactics-rebellion.html">rebellion against God</a> (oops, modern theology,
or liberal, progressive, or whatever the buzzword-of-the-month is), tell
them warnings against adultery and so on were only for that time, we’re
more modern so if a husband wants to visit strip clubs, be a drunk,
consort with prostitutes … that’s fine.</p>
<p>I’m sure their wives (or husbands for those liberal wives) would quickly
abandon modern, progressive, liberal theology in less than a heartbeat —
it turns out not even proponents of liberal theology accept what they’re
shoveling.</p>
<p>If they don’t buy what they’re shoveling, why should you?</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
