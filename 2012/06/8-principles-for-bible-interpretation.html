  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Liberal “Christians” (and yes, we use the term <em>very</em> loosely) create
some rather … ahem … strange ideas allegedly from the Bible like <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">social justice</a>,
(which appears nowhere in the NT), abnormal <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/06/red-letter-christianity-clueless-about-sin.html">definitions of sin</a>,
and more, usually resulting from the bizarre philosophy of
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/11/post-modern-philosophy-church.html">post-modernism</a>.</p>
<p>But the lurking question: how <em>should</em> we interpret the Bible?</p>
<p>Liberals frequently use methods allowing them to pick-and-choose what
is—and is not—God’s Word. They thus can get whatever radical ideology
they want; they claim to be “Christian” while <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/06/liberal-theology-begins-with-denying-the-bible.html">denying the Bible</a>.</p>
<p>How can we avoid the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/06/the-treachery-of-trendy.html">treachery of trendy</a>?
Let’s use common sense (instead of buzzwords and “scholarship”).</p>
<h2>1. The Bible is the inspired, inerrant Word of God</h2>
<p>Sure, for most Christians this is obvious. Yet some reject it for the
Prego jar of the Bible <em>containing</em> the Word of God, not <em>being</em> the
Word of God.</p>
<p>Thus, <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/06/liberal-theology-begins-with-denying-the-bible.html">they can tell you what applies</a>,
and what doesn’t (since they’re “scholars”).</p>
<p>Of course, so-called scholars miss Paul to Timothy — “<strong>All</strong> scripture
is given by inspiration of God…”. Certainly Paul’s words to Timothy must
be the first part of the Bible they deny … and it’s all downhill from
there for the liberals.</p>
<h2>2. God Wants You to Understand</h2>
<p>It’s not locked to be available only for scholars. You don’t require a
Phd to understand the Bible. Yes, a few theology concepts are
challenging, but as Chuck Missler says the Bible is shallow enough for a
child to wade in, yet deep enough for an elephant to immerse in.</p>
<p>God <em>wants</em> you to understand. No mediator (ahem — scholar) is required
between yourself and God.</p>
<h2>3. The Bible is all about Jesus</h2>
<p>Sometimes you’ll come to something which just sounds strange or doesn’t
seem to fit. In that case, try placing Jesus as the focus and see what
happens.</p>
<p>For example, why would the Mosaic Law have a sacrifice when a leper is
cured (Leviticus 14)? Leprosy was incurable.</p>
<p>Well, when you arrive at Matthew 8 and Jesus cleanses a leper, He tells
the leper to “offer the gift that Moses commanded, <strong>for a testimony
unto them</strong>.” That part of the Law lie dormant for thousands of years,
waiting for <em>one</em> event to demonstrate Jesus’ deity.</p>
<h2>4. Take the Bible seriously</h2>
<p>When people hear you take the Bible seriously, you might get a reply you
think God has feathers then, because we can take rest under shadow of
His wings.</p>
<p>Wrong. Of course the Bible uses idioms and figures of speech. But when
it specifies a period of time, for what reason would you ignore the
actual, literal meaning? No logical one, to be sure.</p>
<p>Sometimes alternate ideas pop up because we don’t understand or see
<em>how</em> something could work out. For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Israel back in the land — absurd until 1948. Before then, “scholars”
could either think it was a mistake, or it must have mant something
else. No, it meant Israel would return to the land.</li>
<li>Everyone seeing the abomination of desolation of the temple. Until
satellite, how could Jesus’ warning be true? When <em>you</em> see it? But
if cameras were in the temple, and using modern technology, it’s
quite easy to see how the whole world will see events at the temple
site.</li>
<li>Flesh dissolving in Zechariah. Absurd with the ancient warfare of
swords. But with modern atomic or biological weapons?</li>
</ol>
<p>In the past, people questioned what those passages meant — simply
because they couldn’t see how they worked. Well, we know they work
<em>exactly</em> as written.</p>
<p>The Bible means what it says, and says what it means, or when the plain
sense of the text makes sense seek no other sense.</p>
<h2>5. The Bible doesn’t contradict itself</h2>
<p>It’s internally consistent, thus if someone’s idea of what a passage
means contradicts something else in the Bible, their wacky idea must be
false.</p>
<p>For example, one of the hot topics is the idea you can lose your
salvation. But suppose you can, what does that mean?</p>
<p>It means you do (or don’t) do <em>something</em> to earn your salvation
(works), but worse, it means Jesus’ death on the cross was both
<em>insufficient</em> and <em>incomplete</em> for salvation. I’ve yet to encounter a
person claiming it’s possible to lose salvation be comfortable with
those conclusions, yet they logically follow.</p>
<p>Since we’ve come to an absurd result and contradiction, the original
idea (losing salvation) <em>must</em> be wrong.</p>
<h2>6. The Bible says what it says, and people are free to accept or reject it.</h2>
<p>You have free will to accept or reject any or all of the Bible as you
see fit. Of course, liberals look rather silly trying to make the Bible
agree with their radical ideology.</p>
<h2>7. Physics helps with understanding</h2>
<p>If you <em>really</em> want to dig into the Bible, many times Physics helps
illuminate areas, or solve contentious issues. We covered this in our
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/category/science-and-the-bible.html">science and the Bible series</a>, but
consider these two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/05/physics-and-the-bible-relativity.html">Calvinism vs Arminianism</a> — solved by relativity.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/05/physics-and-the-bible-quantum-tunneling.html">Zerubbabel’s mountain in Zechariah</a> — Quantum Tunneling.</li>
</ul>
<h2>8. Don’t play Buzzword Bingo</h2>
<p>Frankly, I don’t understand much of the fully buzzword compliant stuff.
After reading some “scholarly” works, I’m left wondering what the #$@!
they’re talking about. Perhaps you’ve experienced that problem as well.</p>
<p>I’m reminded of a Walter Martin story he had with a liberal professor
while he was in school about a “scholarly” article in a magazine (which
I’ll paraphrase):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Did you see the article on Saturday?” (Martin to his professor)</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, very profound,” replies the liberal professor.</p>
<p>“You know sir I’m a hard worker — working though college — and money
isn’t easy to come by.”</p>
<p>“Yes, you’re a hard worker Mr. Martin.”</p>
<p>“So sir, I’ll give you $100 if you can tell me what this means.”</p>
<p>[ <em>Liberal professor ponders the article a bit</em> ]</p>
<p>“Darned if I know!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scholars string together buzzwords meaning nothing. Don’t be intimated
by buzzword-bingo. Most of the time it’s just <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/01/the-trouble-with-scholarship.html">garbage hand-waving</a>,
trying to trick you into buying what they’re shoveling by their volume,
not their substance.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There you have it, 8 principles for studying your Bible.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Bible is the inspired, inerrant Word of God.</li>
<li>God Wants You to Understand.</li>
<li>The Bible is all about Jesus.</li>
<li>Take the Bible seriously.</li>
<li>The Bible doesn’t contradict itself</li>
<li>People are free to accept or reject the Bible.</li>
<li>Physics helps with understanding.</li>
<li>Don’t play buzzword bingo.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, it’s time to <a href="https://framesofreferencellc.com/catalog/9780983111733/">get back in the game</a> because
you don’t want to <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/09/matrix-guide-christianity.html">live in The Matrix</a> — after all, it’s 2:59 AM.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
