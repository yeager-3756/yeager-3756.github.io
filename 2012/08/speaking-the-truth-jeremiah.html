  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>We discussed <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/07/avoiding-the-call-moses.html">Moses avoiding the call of God</a>,
and the (in)famous attempt of <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/08/avoiding-the-call-jonah.html">Jonah to duck the
call</a>.
This week we’ll cover a similar situation — not avoiding the call, but
not exactly thrilled about the assignment either.</p>
<p>Jeremiah.</p>
<p>Who could blame Jeremiah for not wanting to speak in the Lord’s name?
Chapter 38 finds Jeremiah minding his own business, speaking the Lord’s
word, which wasn’t exactly well-received by the king. The response? Toss
him in a pit, where Jeremiah sinks in the mud.</p>
<p>Not cool, guys.</p>
<p>You might think with responses like that — and watching the nation you
love slip away — you might just want to keep your mouth shut. After all,
nobody’s listening anyway. Well, Jeremiah thought the same thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then I said, “I will not make mention of Him, Nor speak anymore in His
name.” But His word was in my heart like a burning fire Shut up in my
bones; I was weary of holding it back, And I could not. (Jeremiah 20:9 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even when he wanted to, the call was so strong he simply couldn’t ignore
it.</p>
<p>It’s <em>truth</em> which matters, not popularity. Many people don’t like
truth, and attack any person proclaiming something they don’t want to
hear. That’s the problem from Jeremiah’s time, and the same disease
infects our discourse as well.</p>
<p>As John Loeffler says “I won’t sit down and I won’t shut up.” It’s time
for the timid attitude of Christians to end. Be polite, be courteous,
but speak the truth. It won’t be popular for sure, but <strong>truth isn’t a
popularity contest</strong>.</p>
<p>If you follow politics, you’ve noticed swinging polls recently. Why?
With the country where it is, and the unemployment, inflation, and so
on, this election should be similar to the Reagan/Carter election, but
it likely won’t be. Why not?</p>
<p><strong>This is the first post-issue election in history.</strong></p>
<p>Issues and truth don’t matter anymore. Many pundits claim this will be
the nastiest election in history (and they’re right) but they miss the
reason <em>why</em> — <strong>issues and truth no longer matter</strong>. It’s not simply
spin (putting the facts in the best possible light for your side), it’s
a <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/01/shifting-sands-of-post-modern-philosophy.html">total abandonment of truth</a>
— the only question is can the idea be sold?</p>
<p>The only tactic some groups employ will be throwing mud, and if enough
sticks it might provide victory. The antidote remains simple: speak the
truth, and realize it won’t be popular. With a bit of luck, truth will
convince people.</p>
<p>It’s a post-issue election, as truth, integrity, and honesty are tossed
out the window. Where are you? Will you stay in the game and help speak
the truth, even if it’s not popular? Or will you stay on the bench?</p>
<p>Jeremiah stayed in the game.</p>
<p>What’s holding you back right now? After all, it’s 2:59 AM.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
