  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Last week we discussed <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/07/avoiding-the-call-moses.html">Moses avoiding the call of God</a>;
this week we’ll cover a story even people who’ve never been in church
have heard of: Jonah and the whale.</p>
<p>Like Moses, Jonah received the call of God, and like Moses, attempted to
avoid it — at least until God explained it a bit more clearly.</p>
<p>Most people are familiar with the story: Jonah received the call, blah
blah blah. Jonah travels in the opposite direction, swallowed by a fish,
blah blah blah. Been there, heard it in Sunday school as a kid. What’s
new? Hey, isn’t a new episode of American Idol on tonight?</p>
<p>I can see the eyes begin to roll back in your head and the glaze of
stupid-vision taking over. STAY WITH ME KID! STAY AWAKE! DON’T LEAVE ME!
YOU’RE GONNA MAKE IT (sorry for the overused war-movie cliches).</p>
<p>Sure, you know the story, but as Paul warned in Hebrews 2:1, “we must
give the more earnest heed to the things we have heard, lest we drift
away (NKJV),” so here’s the part of the story you’re familiar with.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD,
and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish. So he
paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto
Tarshish from the presence of the LORD. (Jonah 1:3)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Besides the obvious absurdity of Jonah fleeing from the presence of the
Lord, there’s nothing new here. Read it a bunch of times (gee, the
Sunday School flannel board story sure was great, wasn’t it?).</p>
<p>Like Moses, Jonah wasn’t exactly thrilled with God’s call. In fact, he
actively tried to run away. But who gets an assist in the stats?</p>
<p>Satan.</p>
<p>Huh? I don’t see his name <em>anywhere</em> in the text. Exactly. If you <em>knew</em>
he influenced situations, you’d immediately recognize and avoid it,
would you not? Of course — stealth technology wasn’t invented by the
Pentagon, you know.</p>
<p>Okay, back to the story. Jonah made up his mind to avoid God’s call, but
conveniently placed where he would stumble across it was a ship. Gee
what’s that doing here? Hey, I know, if I take a cruise on that ship I
can avoid God’s call. How coincidental I stumbled across it.</p>
<p>Not really. Remember the stat sheet — who got the assist?</p>
<p>When you want to avoid your duty, you can count on your friendly
adversary to provide a convenient and easily accessible way to avoid
your duty. Don’t take it … unless you like to spend weekends in a fish.</p>
<p>Jonah finally got in the game.</p>
<p>What’s holding you back right now? After all, it’s 2:59 AM.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
