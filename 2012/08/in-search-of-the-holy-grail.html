  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Man always seems to be on a quest of some kind. Indiana Jones. Fountain
of Youth. Ab-buster 2000. I read an article about silver-bullet
poisoning — we spend so much time looking for the magic cure, the easy
fix, the simple solution, the big payoff, we don’t actually <em>do</em>
anything about the real problem.</p>
<p>It’s the elusive search for <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/08/what-you-need-know-about-free-lunch.html">the free lunch</a>,
a mythical creature never found in reality.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this disease infects Christians as well. From <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">social justice</a>
and its promise to shift your responsibility to care for others to the
government, to the attitude of the average pew-warmer waiting to be
spoon-fed regurgitated leftovers from an overworked pastor, Christians
can be lazy, refusing to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0983111731">get back in the game</a>.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>We’ve fallen victim to the same disease infecting the rest of the world
(actually, <em>two</em> problems):</p>
<ol>
<li>Failure to learn (sitting in a pew year after year and yet failing
to actually learn anything).</li>
<li>Failure to apply (after obtaining a good Biblical foundation,
failure to apply it to daily life).</li>
</ol>
<p>When faced with a situation, you must consider what you’ve learned, and
then apply what you know. It requires planning, preparation, and
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/07/why-stubbornness-is-a-good-thing.html">stubbornness</a>.
It’s <em>your</em> job to learn, study, and then apply what you know.</p>
<p>But wait, some say, doesn’t this mean you don’t trust God? If you’re
telling me to plan and prepare, should we not trust God?</p>
<p>The answer arrives from a simple question: did you eat breakfast this
morning? Or did you trust God a bowl of Fruit Loops would magically
appear in your bed? If you rose out of bed, opened the cabinet, poured
cereal in the bowl, and dumped milk on it, well, how sad for your lack
of faith. We’ll pray for you.</p>
<p>Preparation requires action, not slothfulness, and <em>never</em> negates trust
in God.</p>
<p>Get back in the game — that takes study, effort, and application. Fail
any of those and you won’t be successful.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
