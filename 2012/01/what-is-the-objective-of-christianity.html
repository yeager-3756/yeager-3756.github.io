  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>We’re continually amazed at attempts by “Christians” to subvert the
clear Word of the Bible. Well, not really, as heretics have attempted to
deceive Christians since the founding of the church. Rather we’re amazed
the church won’t recognize these false un-Biblical ideas for what they
are, perhaps because many Christians are Bible illiterate.</p>
<p>Today’s question: What is the object of Christianity?</p>
<blockquote cite="http://sojo.net/blogs/2011/12/27/bait-and-switch-contemporary-christianity" Title="Sojourners">
<p>Specifically, when the student said “I need to work on my relationship with God” I knew exactly what she meant. It meant praying more, getting up early to study the bible, to start going back to church. Things along those lines. The goal of these activities is to get “closer” to God. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That doesn’t sound too bad. The problem comes as the author doesn’t
<em>want</em> that to be what Christianity is about (although they do admit
nothing is wrong with getting closer to God).</p>
<blockquote cite="http://sojo.net/blogs/2011/12/27/bait-and-switch-contemporary-christianity" Title="Sojourners">
<p>But all too often “working on my relationship with God” has almost nothing to do with trying to become a more decent human being. … The point is that one can fill a life full of spiritual activities without ever, actually, trying to become a more decent human being. Much of this activity can actually distract one from becoming a more decent human being.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sound crazy? The author goes on to state instead of spending two hours
in Bible study, Worship, and fellowship on Sunday, you’d be better off
working on being a better person at lunch.</p>
<p>Add this to the list of strange non-Biblical ideas along with <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">social justice</a>,
the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/05/church-common-good.html">common good</a>, and
bizarre <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/06/red-letter-christianity-clueless-about-sin.html">Godless definitions of sin</a>,
while these people <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/09/matrix-guide-christianity.html">live in the Matrix</a> of deception.</p>
<p>Before we get attacked saying you shouldn’t <em>want</em> to become a better
person, the author misses not cheating on your wife and so on is a
<em>result</em> of your relationship with God. You’ll naturally do some things,
and <em>not</em> do others if your relationship with God is right, as we wrote
in our book <a href="https://framesofreferencellc.com/catalog/9780983111702/">The Troubled Church</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps you recall an old episode of MASH (the old TV show, yes we’re
old-timers), with BJ and Hawkeye talking about having an affair while
stationed in Korea. Hawkeye (as you’ll recall) was the skirt-chaser,
while BJ remained faithful to his wife, even in a time of war in a
country far away. Naturally Hawkeye didn’t understand how (or why) he
could do that. BJ responded it wasn’t because he believed God would
strike him down, or even that cheating on his wife was wrong, he
simply didn’t want to. (“<a href="https://framesofreferencellc.com/catalog/9780983111702/">The Troubled Church</a>”, page 24)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>David murdered because his relationship with God was wrong — which is
why he prayed create in me a clean heart, and he states his sin was
against God, and God alone. If David’s relationship with God was
correct, he would <em>not</em> have killed anyone. But the flip isn’t true —
working on “being a better person” will not necessarily result in a
better relationship with God.</p>
<p>Get your relationship with God right, and other actions fall into place.</p>
<p>Christianity is a relationship with God. If you get that wrong, you’re
likely wrong on everything else — which is why heresies are so
dangerous, as they use the same vocabulary as traditional Christianity,
but it’s nothing more than the poison of trendy philosophy wrapped in a
thin candy shell of Christian terminology hiding the toxic poison
inside.</p>
<p>Swallow it at your peril.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
