  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Rachel Held Evans reviews “The Bible Made Impossible”, what appears to
be a fairly liberal book (stay-tuned for the stunning—if honest—goal of
the author).</p>
<p>You’ll frequently discover so-called scholars and experts use
intelligently sounding words and phrases, but when considering them you
find they say nothing (or as we’ll see, end up in a no-mans land of
logical inconsistency). In Physics we called that
“<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hand-waving">hand-waving</a>”, or
an attempt to hide you have no idea what you’re talking about by many
words and equations.</p>
<p>Of course, those attempts <em>never</em> fooled the professor, because anyone
examining the hand-waving in any depth immediately notices it.</p>
<p>Today’s scholarly hand-waving — denying the traditional, orthodox, idea
the Bible is the inerrant Word of God. That’s just not popular with the
trendy denial-of-absolute post-modern philosophy, so it’s got to go.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://rachelheldevans.com/biblicism-christian-smith-bible-impossible">
<p>What I say here is simply that the Biblicism that in much of American evangelicalism is presupposed to be the cornerstone to <b>Christian truth and faithfulness is misguided and impossible</b>. It does not and cannot live up to its own claims. [emphasis added]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what is this misguided and impossible biblicism?</p>
<blockquote cite="http://rachelheldevans.com/biblicism-christian-smith-bible-impossible">
<p>“By bibliclism,” writes Smith, “I mean a theory about the Bible that emphasizes together its exclusive authority, infallibility, perspicuity, self-sufficiency, internal consistency, self-evident meaning, and universal applicability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds scholarly, does it not (where’s my smoking jacket again, you
know, the one with the elbow patches)? Let’s look at each claim labeled
“misguided and impossible”.</p>
<h2>Exclusive Authority</h2>
<p>Authority is (by definition) exclusive. If you agree with someone, you
admit they have authority, and if not, some method must be used to
determine what authority will be adhered to. Either way, authority
<em>must</em> be exclusive. If you have authority, others don’t.</p>
<p>“All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for
doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness”
2 Timothy 3:16). If it’s given by by the designer and creator, it’s
authoritative.</p>
<h2>Infallibility</h2>
<p>He’s surely not saying God makes mistakes, and to believe otherwise is
misguided and impossible? Not so fast, my friend — the only way to
<em>prove</em> or know God makes mistakes is if you knew <em>more</em> than God. A
certain angel tried to place himself on the same level as God and got
into quite a bit of trouble, if we recall.</p>
<p>We’ll not touch that with a 10-foot pole.</p>
<h2>Perspicuity</h2>
<p>I had to look up that word, because I’m a simple guy (not like
“scholars”).</p>
<p><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Perspicuity">Perspicuity</a> means
clarity, plainness or the quality of being perspicuous (perhaps this was
the author’s idea of funny wordplay, because by using a word not
commonly known, he’s <em>not</em> being perspicuous. Sigh).</p>
<p>The New Testament was written in common Greek, by non-scholarly, common
men. It would be hard for them <em>not</em> to be clear and understandable by
regular people. That doesn’t mean the <em>ideas</em> are simple, but their
communication is.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://rachelheldevans.com/biblicism-christian-smith-bible-impossible">
<p>the Bible, after their very best efforts to understand it, says and teaches very different things about most significant topics…It becomes beside the point to assert a text to be solely authoritative or inerrant, for instance, when, lo and behold, it gives rise to a host of many divergent teachings on important matters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice the argument shifting. Because someone doesn’t <em>believe</em> it says
what it says means it doesn’t really say what it says? What is the most
important matter in the Bible? The Gospel. Some liberals like to play
games with definitions — specifically with what the gospel is. Strange,
since Paul exactly defines the Gospel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached
unto you … Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And
that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to
the scriptures… (1 Corinthians 15)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">someone re-defines the clear and obvious definition of the gospel</a>,
does that mean the Bible isn’t clear? Of course not. It means either
someone hasn’t read what Paul told the Corinthians (in which case
education is the answer), or they <em>do</em> know what it means, and either
reject it, or want to twist it to their preconceived
political/theological/social ideas (in which case they’re trying to
deceive you).</p>
<p>Either way, the Gospel—as defined by Paul—remains clear, no matter what
people think or claim (oops, let’s be scholarly, Paul was
<em>perspicuous</em>). Yes, it’s possible many confused ideas could develop
from a clear text.</p>
<p>However, it’s <em>wrong</em> to claim those divergent philosophies imply the
Bible isn’t clear on the Gospel. We challenge anyone to honestly say 1
Corinthians 15 isn’t clear (oops, “perspicuous” darn, I keep forgetting
to sound scholarly). If someone doesn’t believe the world is round,
would you say pictures of the round earth can give rise to a host of
divergent teachings?</p>
<p>Of course not, you’d say the person doesn’t accept obvious facts.</p>
<p>The same with the Bible. If <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/09/social-justice-restoring-honor-beck-vs-sojourners.html">someone doesn’t like to accept the truth of the Gospel</a>
(substituting social justice as the heart of the Gospel instead of
Christ), that doesn’t make truth untruth.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/10/tactics-rebellion.html">The Tactics of Rebellion</a> — it’s not the
Bible isn’t clear, it’s the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/11/post-modern-philosophy-church.html">problem of post-modern philosophy</a>
infecting the church.</p>
<p>Are there things hard to understand? You bet. Are there things we
<em>don’t</em> understand? Of course. That doesn’t mean they’re not clear
(oops, “perspicuous”, I did it again). We also may not have all the
pieces yet. Certainly in Daniel’s time they didn’t understand all what
was revealed to him, but as time moves forward, our understanding of
what’s clearly written improves.</p>
<p>The book of Revelation isn’t hard because it’s not clear, but <em>because
it is</em>; people don’t like what it says so they try and squirm out of it.</p>
<h2>Self-sufficiency</h2>
<p>Is anything else needed besides Jesus? If not, it’s self-sufficient. Is
the author actually implying the sufficiency of Christ is misguided and
impossible? I hope not.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean it’s all you <em>want</em>, but it’s all you <em>need</em>.</p>
<h2>Internal Consistency</h2>
<p>If it’s infallible (inerrant, or no mistakes), it <em>must</em> be — by
definition — consistent.</p>
<h2>Self-evident Meaning</h2>
<p>If the Bible says one-third of the grass burned up, or 70 weeks are
determined for the people, that’s what it means. Sure, the Bible does
use word-play in some areas, the problem arises when “scholars” <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/05/phony-scholarship-was-new-testament-forged.html">take obvious meanings</a>
and change them into <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/06/pseudo-scholarship-even-atheists-dismiss.html">bizarre thoughts</a>
demonstrating they <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2008/12/deutero-isaiah-hypothesis.html">fail to read the text</a>
they’re a so-called “expert” on.</p>
<h2>Universal Applicability</h2>
<p>An infallible, self-sufficient, consistent message from the creator of
the cosmos would have universal applicability, would it not?</p>
<h2>What is the Bible Then?</h2>
<p>If he’s right, the Bible is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not authoritative.</li>
<li>Error-prone and inconsistent.</li>
<li>Unclear.</li>
<li>Insufficient.</li>
<li>Not applicable.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then what’s the good of it? Toss it on the scrap heap. You can’t have it
both ways — <em>if</em> the Bible is the inerrant Word of God it must be
understood to be the final authority, while <strong>if he’s right no reason
exists to read the Bible</strong>; it’s error-prone and not applicable, so why
bother?</p>
<h2>Don’t be Deceived</h2>
<p>Don’t be ripped off by impressive sounding “scholarship”. What’s the
end-goal of these “scholars”? At least they’re up-front about it:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://rachelheldevans.com/biblicism-christian-smith-bible-impossible">
<p>The ‘biblicism’ that pervades much of American evangelicalism is untenable and <b>needs to be abandoned</b> in favor of a better approach to Christian truth and authority… [emphasis added]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At least they’re honest — they want you to <strong>abandon the solid rock of
the Word for the shifting sands of value relativism</strong>, giving up
perspicuity (admit it, you didn’t think I could work that in again, did
you?) in the process.</p>
<p>Don’t fall for it. Don’t be conned by hand-waving or those living in
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/09/matrix-guide-christianity.html">The Matrix</a> of
deception. Stay anchored to the absolute reference of the Word of God.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/03/coming-church-division.html">division is coming</a>
— those that accept the Bible as the inerrant Word of God (thus we
should live and follow that absolute truth), and those following
post-modern philosophy denying some or all of God’s Word.</p>
<p>Which group do you choose?</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
