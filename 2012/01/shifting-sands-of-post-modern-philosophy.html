  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Post-modern philosophy may be the latest fad in “Christian” circles
(emerging-this, post-that, beyond-whatever, neo-something, social
justice, etc.), but when an author complains about what he calls
“neo-fundamentalism”, he actually reveals <em>why</em> post-modern philosophy
fails so spectacularly (although he probably didn’t mean to).</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/rogereolson/2012/01/neo-fundamentalism-excellent-but-somewhat-lengthy-essay/">
<p>The driving force behind neo-fundamentalism, as with historic fundamentalism, is a “remnant mentality.” Neo-fundamentalists believe they alone are remaining true to the fullness of the gospel and orthodox faith while the rest of the evangelical church is in grave, near-apocalyptic danger of theological drift, moral laxity, and compromise with a postmodern culture – a culture which they see as being characterized by a skepticism towards Enlightenment conceptions of “absolute truth,” a pluralistic blending of diverse beliefs, values, and cultures, and a suspicion of hierarchies and traditional sources of authority.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/11/post-modern-philosophy-church.html">define post-modernism</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… it holds realities to be plural and relative, and to be dependent on
whom the interested parties are and of what their interests consist.
It supports the belief that there is no absolute truth and that the
way in which different people perceive the world is subjective.
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In general, emerging church,
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/11/post-modern-philosophy-church.html">post-modern</a>,
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">social justice</a>,
red-letter Christianity, liberal, and progressive groups all share some
characteristics of post-modern philosophy — mainly the denial of
absolute truth, and the desire to redefine terms and ideas from what the
Bible said, or change theology to fit culture.</p>
<p>That is, of course, a dangerous idea. Once you start changing the Bible,
<em>who</em> gets to decide what anything means, <em>how</em> do they do it, and
<em>what</em> gives them the authority to do so? Changing the Bible to fit
culture is <em>never</em> a good idea.</p>
<p>Post-modern philosophy at its core denies absolute truth. Thus the Bible
becomes … well … <em>whatever you want it to be</em>. Want to cheat on your
wife? Sure, post-modernize those passages — they were just for another
time you know (like qualifications for elders, church leadership roles,
definitions of sin and the Gospel, and so on).</p>
<p>Alcoholism? Post-modernize away! Don’t like <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/06/red-letter-christianity-clueless-about-sin.html">God’s definition of sin</a>?
Hey, let’s change it to fit with modern culture. Post-modernism to the
rescue! Using their own post-modern philosophy it’s quick and easy to
prove <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/04/jesus-was-republican-not-democrat.html">Jesus was a Republican, not a Democrat</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, <strong>it’s impossible to prove otherwise</strong>, as long as you’re
using relativistic post-modern philosophy. Jesus was a Bush-loving,
tax-cutting, small-government Republican who dislikes Clinton, Obama,
welfare, taxes, and Democrats. Don’t bother trying to show otherwise, as
you can’t (as long as we use post-modern philosophy and its shifting
definitions and “cultural norms”).</p>
<p>Ultimately, post-modern “Christianity” ends up in the same place as
atheism — morality, God, and religion becomes whatever <em>man</em> wants it to
be, and <em>never</em> defined by God (Richard Dawkins says “Moral philosophic
reasoning and a shifting zeitgeist”) as <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/03/atheism-poison-liberal-theology.html">the poison of liberal theology</a>
moves towards atheism.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/12/problem-morality-where-does-it-come.html">Atheists</a>
and post-modernists end up in the same boat together — no absolute truth
exists, and truth becomes whatever society wants it to be. <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/06/more-dawkins-morality-no-absolutes.html">Richard Dawkins
says</a>
he doesn’t <em>want</em> absolutes, lining up perfectly with “Christians” who
change the Bible to suit them.</p>
<p>Wait a minute, you say, you can’t just change the Bible because you want
to be a drunk. Exactly. So why do some believe they can change what God
said about other things — like qualifications for elders, church
leadership, and more?</p>
<p>Post-modern “Christians” (yes we use the term <em>very</em> loosely) find
themselves in the same paradox as Dawkins — whether they realize it or
not (or admit it), because in spite of their denials, absolute truth
(Biblical or otherwise) exists and is knowable …</p>
<p>… Absolutely.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
