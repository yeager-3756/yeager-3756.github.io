  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>In <a href="https://framesofreferencellc.com/catalog/9780983111733/">Get Back in the Game</a> I related a story about breaking my arm during Taekwondo training — I did
something I shouldn’t have, and got injured because of it. I managed to
finish the session, not discovering the extent of the injury until the
next morning, when a X-Ray revealed a bone not exactly where it should
be.</p>
<p>When it occurred, the pain was severe, but not intolerable. Pausing for
a moment to collect my thoughts, I returned to training. Yet in those
few moments, I faced the following choices:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go down. Give in. Quit.</li>
<li>Keep going in spite of the pain.</li>
</ol>
<p>I tend to be stubborn, so I chose option 2 (not knowing how bad the
injury really was) — you can call that stiff-necked and stubborn.</p>
<p>Do you know where the first instance of stiff-necked occurs in the
Bible? Exodus 32, with Moses on the mountain and the people complaining
to Aaron they don’t know where Moses is. In Moses’ absence they conjure
up the bright idea of building a golden calf.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which
thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves.
They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them:
they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have
sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which
have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. And the LORD said unto
Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked
people. (Exodus 32:7–9)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That episode didn’t turn out very well — from that and other events we
conclude stubbornness is bad.</p>
<h2>Stubbornness is Good … Sometimes</h2>
<p>Don’t make the mistake stubbornness is <em>always</em> wrong. Sure, many times
it is, but we do have examples where being stubborn was actually a good
thing.</p>
<p>Recall Daniel chapter 1, as Daniel is carried off into captivity. He’s
just a teenager at the time, but the first chapter reveals Daniel
“purposed in his heart not to defile himself.”</p>
<p>That’s stubborn and stiff-necked, but in a good way, as he prepared
himself for what lay ahead — he understood <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/07/lookout-for-that-one-way-street.html">life would be different</a>
from what he previously knew.</p>
<p>A myth exists for unprepared people that when crises comes, they’ll rise
to the occasion. Few things are further from the truth (well, maybe “I’m
from the government, and I’m here to help you”).</p>
<p>You’ll rarely rise to the occasion, you’ll sink to whatever level of
training and forethought you’ve had before; you’ve seen ill-prepared
people panic during crisis, have you not?</p>
<p>For Taekwondo, I mentally picture everything which might happen — every
kick is a knockout, every evasive action works perfectly, every counter
technique to the opponent’s succeeds (of course, sometimes the mind is
willing, but the body is weak, but that’s the reason for physical
training — to get those two as close together as possible).</p>
<p>So what about the broken arm? The decision was already made — no
quitting. When the crisis arrived, the only question became: <em>how</em> to
overcome this obstacle? Stubbornness and a refusal to give in.</p>
<p>One bright note to the broken arm: it’s no longer a question of what
happens if I’m injured in a crisis. Since I’ve already been down that
road, if something similar ever occurs, it’s more like “oh yeah, I’ve
been in this position before, <em>and I know I can make it</em>.” As my father
once said about his experience in the military: it’s a million-dollar
experience I wouldn’t give a nickel to go through again.</p>
<p><strong>Obvious note</strong>: I’m not a doctor, and <strong>nothing here is meant as
medical advice</strong>. Every person must consider their own situation and
respond in their own manner. <em>What works for me may not for you, and
what works for you may not for me</em>. God gave you a brain and the ability
to reason. Use it.</p>
<h2>You Don’t Plan to Fail, You Fail to Plan</h2>
<p>Like Daniel, you must pre-decide <em>how</em> you’ll handle events. Where is
the line you won’t cross? What doctrine will you <em>never</em> compromise on?
They say every person has their price (not just in money) — do you? Have
you thought about it?</p>
<ul>
<li>When heresy comes into your church, have you thought about how to
counter it?</li>
<li>When crisis comes to your family, have you considered action plans?</li>
<li>When your marriage is in trouble, do you think about quitting?</li>
</ul>
<p>Each person differs, but you <em>must</em> figure out your action plan—just
like Daniel did—<em>before</em> the crisis comes, because people generally
don’t rise to the occasion, they sink to whatever preparedness came
before.</p>
<p>A quote attributed to many golfers says “The more I practice, the
luckier I get” — be prepared <em>before</em> you need it.</p>
<p>… because it’s 2:59 AM.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I wrote this post just hours before the nutjob in Colorado
shot up a midnight viewing of the new Batman movie, but the lesson
remains critical.</p>
<p>If you’re in a movie theater, do you know where the exits are? A primary
<em>and</em> a backup in case the primary is blocked? Men, are you ready to
protect your family in event of crisis? Do you know some basic
self-defense? Do you carry a good multi-tool in case a disaster like an
earthquake requires you to cut, pry, or saw your family’s way to safety?
And many more issues you must consider … <em>if</em> you want to be prepared.</p>
<p>Sure, it’s a one-in-a-million chance, but it <em>does</em> happen (they’re
called “Black Swan Events”).</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if it’s <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/02/why-studying-heresy-is-important.html">heresy coming into your church</a>
from strange programs abandoning the Bible, or natural disasters, or
crazies in movie theaters. If you haven’t prepared <em>before</em> the event
occurs, you won’t be in good condition to make it through.</p>
<p>That’s the real reality many people refuse to face — those <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/09/matrix-guide-christianity.html">living in FantasyLand</a> versus
those who know it’s 2:59AM.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
