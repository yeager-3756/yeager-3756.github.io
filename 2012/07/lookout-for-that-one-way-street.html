  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Perhaps nothing is more engrained in culture than the fireman saving the
trapped woman in the burning building, an image repeating itself over
and over through the years. As seen during 9/11, life imitates art as
heroes entered buildings they <em>knew</em> were unsafe to enter. Yet they did
it anyway, and when asked about it, you get the aw-schucks “just doing
my job, ma’am” response.</p>
<p>Yet what happens when a brave fireman actually <em>does</em> what we expect
them to do, what the essence of their character is? The end isn’t
exactly like the fictional story.</p>
<p>First, here’s the real account about the fireman and the burning
building.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.myfoxphilly.com/story/18962723/hero-firefighter-says-he-got-heat-from-city-brass-over-rescue" title="My Fox Philly">
<p>Describing what he did next, Cheney said, “I take a quick breath, rip my helmet off, give her the mask – it’s on positive pressure, which means it just blows smoke away from her – and I just say, ‘Let’s go.’”</p>
<p>Jackson said, “I felt myself going down the steps, and then all of the sudden I felt something on my face.”</p>
<p>Cheney carried her down the stairs and outside to safety, risking his own life.</p>
<p>“If I was worried about that, I wouldn’t be here, and neither would any of these guys that I work with,” Cheney said. “That’s what we do. That’s who we are.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, no good deed goes unpunished, because as the hero fireman lay
in a hospital bed, he receives a visit from a “top fire department
administrator” … to wish him well for a speedy recovery? To present him
a medal? Not exactly, as he was told “that wasn’t very smart.” Wow.</p>
<p>Crazy? Things have changed. Life is no longer what we knew just a few
years ago as traditional scenes disappear. I’ve known firemen and EMTs,
and (without speaking for them) I think they’d agree — it’s what they
love, it’s their job, it’s their character.</p>
<p>But things have changed — can sanity be returned?</p>
<h2>Check Valves — The One-Way Street</h2>
<p>You can no longer assume life will continue as it has. At certain points
in history, a point of no return is passed — WWI, WWII, the creation of
atomic weapons. Once those events occurred, there’s no going back.</p>
<p>Intended to prevent back-flow, a check valve only allows flow one-way,
and more importantly, doesn’t allow flow to return to its origin.</p>
<p>The problem comes from people believing if you hunker down, you can get
through it and return to what you’re familiar with, but life doesn’t
work that way once we’ve gone through a check valve.</p>
<p>Many people didn’t experience pre WWII society, so that analogy might be
a bit strange. Today it’s Obamacare — and whether you’re for or against
it, it’s a check valve; returning to healthcare the way it was won’t be
possible. Radical changers are coming, and we can’t go back. Your
medical choices, the ability to get care, how and what you’ll pay for it
— those are all check valves.</p>
<p>You can’t hunker down and hope the previous system will return. We’ve
passed through a check valve.</p>
<h2>The Church Check Valve</h2>
<p>Check valves exist in the church as well. Unfortunately the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/03/coming-church-division.html">church will split</a>
as Paul told Timothy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but
after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having
itching ears; And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and
shall be turned unto fables. (2 Timothy 4:3–4)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It might be social justice, post-this, emerging-that, purpose something,
church growth, or some other buzzword, but the church will split into
two groups — those holding a Bible-believing position, and those not.</p>
<p>If you follow popular fads blowing through the church, you know one
common element — “re-interpreting” the Bible for today.</p>
<p>That’s a check valve. Once you travel down that path, there’s little
chance of coming back, only on to the next movement and buzzword, all
devoid of God.</p>
<p>If a “program” comes into your church, it’s <em>probably</em> bad. Why?
<em>Anything</em> replacing God’s Word can’t be superior to it. It doesn’t
matter if they call it social justice, emerging, growth, post-that, or
some other buzzword. They <em>all</em> take you <em>away</em> from God’s Word.</p>
<p>They <em>have</em> to, by definition, because they replace verse by verse study
of God’s Word with whatever the flavor-of-the-month book is. When did
the Word of God become insufficient? And if it <em>is</em> sufficient, why
spend so much time on buzzword philosophy?</p>
<p>Many people like to be <em>called</em> Christian, without actually <em>being</em>
Christian. Thus they’ll be easy pickings for every apostate heresy
coming down the track.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Many people might not believe the casting off of Biblical Christianity
isn’t mainstream; not only is it mainstream, some boldly boast they’re
doing it! From Amazon’s page on the book “Saving Jesus from the Church:
How to Stop Worshiping Christ and Start Following Jesus” you’ll find the
following:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0061568228/" title="Amazon.com">
<p>From One of America’s Leading Pastors, a Bold Call to Restore Christianity’s True Mission: Following Jesus … Taking the best of biblical scholarship, Meyers recasts core Christian concepts in an effort to save Christianity from its obsession with personal salvation. …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>… and containing gems like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapter One — Jesus the teacher, not the savior.</li>
<li>Chapter Three — The Cross as Futility, not Forgiveness.</li>
<li>Chapter Five — Original Blessing, not Original Sin.</li>
</ul>
<p>… and in the Prologue (page 6 of Amazon’s Look Inside):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have never believed in the virgin birth as a biological fact, the
blood atonement … as the foreordained mission of Jesus, the bodily
resurrection as the only way to understand Easter … and I am the
pastor of a church that does not define Christianity this way either.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if you deny the virgin birth, the understanding of Easter as the
resurrection, the cross as not Jesus’ mission (and likely the inerrancy
of the Bible as well), what is Christian about what remains? As Atheist
Christopher Hitchens said:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.portlandmonthlymag.com/arts-and-entertainment/category/books-and-talks/articles/christopher-hitchens/" title="Portland Monthly Magazine">
<p>I would say that if you don’t believe that Jesus of Nazareth was the Christ and Messiah, and that he rose again from the dead and by his sacrifice our sins are forgiven, you’re really not in any meaningful sense a Christian.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whenever you see a phase like taking the best of modern scholarship you
<em>know</em> you’re in trouble.</p>
<p>It should go without saying, but we’re not talking about minor points
(pre-trib/post-trib, Bible translations, calvinism, etc) — but the
defining foundations of Christianity. Majoring in the minors is <em>never</em>
a good idea and leads to church division, but the question remains: how
much of Christianity can be denied, but still call it Christian? Virgin
birth? Inerrancy of the Bible? Resurrection of Christ?</p>
<p>How much foundational doctrine can be discarded before what’s left is no
longer Christianity?</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>When you hear nonsense like the best of modern scholarship, buzzwords
like social justice, common good, collective salvation, growth-this,
emerging-that, ideas like re-interpreting the Bible for modern times,
and more, it’s a good tip those people are <em>not</em> using the Bible.</p>
<p>They may use the same vocabulary as orthodox Christianity, but terms
like Jesus,
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/06/red-letter-christianity-clueless-about-sin.html">sin</a>,
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">Gospel</a>,
salvation do <em>not</em> mean the same, and are <em>not</em> discussing Biblical
Christianity, but some alternate philosophy in place of it.</p>
<h3>Action Plan</h3>
<ol>
<li>Learn! You can’t defend what you don’t know.</li>
<li>Don’t hunker down. Check Valve periods come, and there’s no going
back once society or the church passes though.</li>
<li>Challenge apostate heresies. They’re quite trendy, and with so many
buzzword-compliant programs, we can’t possibly name them all.</li>
<li>Examine your church/teacher. If they’re using alternate gospels like
social justice or otherwise abandoning the Bible, you’ve got a
decision to make — is that environment Biblical and preparing you
for action? Hint: If a church doesn’t teach verse by verse through
the entire Bible, you’re not getting well-balanced spiritual food.</li>
<li>Let us know about programs, as we’d like to investigate them. Leave
a comment or email or tweet us.</li>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
