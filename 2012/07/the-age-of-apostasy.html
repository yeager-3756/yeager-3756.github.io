  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Paul wrote Timothy telling him in the last times perilous times will
come; men will have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof.
Today fully buzzword-compliant streams of nonsense infect the church —
social justice, universal salvation, post-this, emerging-that, and so
on. Are we living in the age of apostasy as groups abandon the solid
rock of God’s Word for the shifting sand of trendy philosophy?</p>
<p>Apostasy means turning away from the basics of your religion. Simply
put, denying what makes Christianity Christian. For example, some may
call the fad of social justice integral to the gospel, yet when Paul
defined the Gospel in 1 Corinthians 15, no mention of social justice
appears.</p>
<p>Thus, if someone replaces Paul’s gospel with the gospel of good works,
liberalism, and social justice, by definition they’re apostates (denying
the basics of Christianity).</p>
<p>You must choose — are the modern fads correct, or the apostle Paul?
Since they proclaim completely different gospels, they can’t <em>both</em> be
right.</p>
<p>Paul certainly understood false teachers would infect the church —
posing as sincere Christians while leading the flock away — as he spent
three <em>years</em> warning the Ephesians about it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take heed, therefore, unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the
which the Holy Spirit hath made you overseers, to feed the church of
God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. For I know this, that
after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not
sparing the flock. Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking
perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. Therefore watch,
and remember, that for the space of three years I ceased not to warn
everyone night and day with tears. (Acts 20:28–31)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trendy fads turn Christianity into apostasy by denying the Gospel. Many
of these heretical fads flow from <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/11/post-modern-philosophy-church.html">post-modern philosophy</a> and
its bizarre, illogical idea of no absolutes.</p>
<p>How insanely illogical is post-modernism? It denies absolutes
(substituting value relativism), except for the one rule declared
absolutely — that being no absolutes exist.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Post-modernism makes as much sense as the Cretan saying “all Cretans are
liars,” as it suffers from a logical error commonly known as the <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liar-paradox/">liar paradox</a> — a statement
which can’t possibly be true because it would invalidate itself.</p>
<p><em>That’s</em> the foundation liberals what us to interpret the Bible with?
Sure, what could go wrong?</p>
<p>Why has the church been seduced by an absurd foundation of
post-modernism and liberal theology? The church has swallowed the same
ridiculous philosophy under a host of buzzwords. Universal salvation.
Common good. Social justice. Collective salvation. Modern theology.
Growth. Progressive. Emerging. Liberal.</p>
<p>All buzzwords. All wrong.</p>
<h2>Action Plan</h2>
<p>So what do you do?</p>
<ol>
<li>Study and Learn the truth. If you want a firm basis to build on,
Chuck Smith’s C-3000 series can be yours for about $30 from <a href="http://store.calvarychapel.com/cccm_store_/catalog/display.php?psku=828147605076">The Word for Today</a>,
<a href="http://www.christianbook.com/through-pastor-chuck-smith-c3000-edition/chuck-smith/pd/107370/1296978574">christianbook.com</a>,
and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002BX7TEY">amazon.com</a>. It’s the
<em>best</em> complete study available (and also the best value).</li>
<li>Politely challenge people shoveling fads like social justice to
Biblically <em>prove</em> their positions. Most likely you’ll discover
supporters use post-modern philosophy or other <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/10/tactics-rebellion.html">tactics of rebellion</a> to justify
ideas not taught to the church in the New Testament by Jesus or any
apostle. If you complete step one above, you’ll be on solid ground
and ready to challenge absurd ideas.</li>
<li>Learn basic logic. Sadly, it’s not taught much anymore; a good
beginning is Jason Lisle’s book “Discerning Truth”. You’ll quickly
learn how frequently people base their ideas on illogical
foundations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Be prepared. Post-modernists and liberals don’t like being told their
emperor has no clothes. You <em>will</em> encounter hostility, but always
remember, liberals and progressives (by any trendy name) base their
philosophy on the liar paradox of claiming no absolute truth exists —
absolutely.</p>
<p>It’s one thing to deny Jesus, God, and the Bible as everyone is free to
do that as they wish. However, when so-called pastors and other leaders
in the church do the same, it’s dangerous to your spiritual well-being.</p>
<p>Are we living in the age of apostasy? If you’ve experienced new fads
infiltrating your church, let us know. It sure seems like it’s popular
to deny the Bible, all while claiming to be Christian.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
