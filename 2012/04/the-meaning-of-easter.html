  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>I read a <em>lot</em> of blogs of all types, but one thing catching me by
surprise was a number of people on a liberal Christian blog saying they
didn’t like Easter, were depressed, didn’t celebrate it, didn’t
understand it, had doubts, or something similar.</p>
<p>What? <em>The</em> defining event of Christianity?</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s because they don’t really understand Easter.</p>
<p>You see, religious people of the liberal/progressive type use <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/06/didactic-dialectic-thought.html">dialectic reasoning</a>
to <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/06/red-letter-christianity-clueless-about-sin.html">shift definitions</a>
and modify (or ignore) what the Bible says. Those groups don’t really
know <em>what</em> they believe, because they’ll believe anything (and
everything … or nothing). That’s the ruinous, deadly poison liberal
theology and <a href="/2011/11/post-modern-philosophy-church.html">post-modern philosophy</a>
infect the church with.</p>
<p>Post-modern liberals deny truth, so the absolute truth of Easter and the
Gospel are lost on them. Some liberals even go far as to <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">replace Easter (the Gospel) with good works</a>
and other strange ideas. For those in that group, it’s no wonder they’re
confused.</p>
<h2>What is the Gospel?</h2>
<p>For all those liberal progressives, let’s remind everyone exactly <em>what</em>
the Gospel is, from Paul:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Moreover, brethren, <strong>I declare to you the gospel</strong> which I preached
to you, which also you received and in which you stand, by which also
you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to
you—unless you believed in vain. For I delivered to you first of all
that which I also received: that <strong>Christ died for our sins according
to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the
third day according to the Scriptures</strong>, and that He was seen by
Cephas, then by the twelve. (1 Corinthians 15:1–5 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul reminded the Galatians that <em>anyone</em> accepting another Gospel is
(to paraphrase) in big trouble. The Gospel is <em>NOT</em> social justice, good
works, common good, happy thoughts, heaven on earth, or any other
liberal/progressive theological nonsense. It’s quite simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Humans are sinners missing God’s requirements.</li>
<li>Thus, to be with a perfect God the penalty for sin <em>must</em> be paid.</li>
<li>That penalty requires a perfect, sinless sacrifice.</li>
<li>Jesus paid that penalty for us.</li>
<li>He died, and rose the third day (Easter!).</li>
<li>By accepting Him as Lord and Savior we can have our sins forgiven.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, <em>that’s</em> good news.</p>
<h2>The Poison of Liberal Theology</h2>
<p>If you’re confused on what the Gospel is, it’s no wonder Easter—the very
foundation of Christianity—becomes confusing as you’ve lost <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/01/what-is-the-objective-of-christianity.html">the objective of
Christianity</a>,
replacing it with some liberal, progressive mumbo-jumbo.</p>
<p>That’s the problem caused by liberal, progressive, emerging, post-modern
theology (or whatever else the latest fully buzzword-compliant term is)
— once you ignore what the text plainly says, you’re left with nothing
as anyone can make the text say anything they want, so the text <em>does</em>
say anything, which means it says … nothing.</p>
<p>And <em>that</em> folks, could certainly cause confusion over Easter.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
