  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>In Part one, we discussed <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/10/lose-the-weight-part-one.html">proofs for God</a>
which don’t solve much, and in part two, we discovered the problem with
those trying to <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/10/lose-the-weight-part-two.html">find God</a>,
but unable to.</p>
<p>This week, we’ll cover the third and final part, which is at the same
time the simplest and the hardest to actually get under your belt.</p>
<p>That third problem? Salvation by Jesus alone. Once again, back to
Hebrews.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… he [Jesus] had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right
hand of the Majesty on high.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He by Himself — third rest. <em>You</em> don’t add anything. It’s not Jesus+.</p>
<p>Of course, you know that already, but do you <em>act</em> like it?</p>
<p>Many people struggle with the possibility of <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2008/01/can-you-lose-your-salvation.html">losing salvation</a>
by something they either do—or don’t—do.</p>
<p>But frequently they don’t follow through to the logical conclusion. If
you believe you do something to either get or maintain salvation, that
means Jesus’ work on the cross was both <em>insufficient</em> and <em>incomplete</em>
for salvation.</p>
<p>That’s not a good place to be.</p>
<p>It’s <em>never</em> Jesus+, and if you think you can lose (or earn) your
salvation by something you do, that position logically states Jesus
never finished the job, and it’s up to humans to complete what He
started.</p>
<p>Of course, that contradicts the Gospels, where Jesus said “It is
finished,” but as we’ve seen before <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/06/liberal-theology-begins-with-denying-the-bible.html">liberal theology</a>
begins with denying the Bible, and ends in
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/category/heresy.html">heresy</a>.</p>
<p>Personally, I’ve <em>never</em> run across someone claiming you can lose your
salvation who also claims Jesus failed to finish what the Father sent
Him to do. However, if you think you can lose your salvation, that’s the
place you end up.</p>
<p>Don’t fall for the lie, stand firm on the unchanging rock.</p>
<p>… because it’s 2:59 AM.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
