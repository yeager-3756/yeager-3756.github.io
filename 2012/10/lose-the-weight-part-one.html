  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Today’s Christian requires a weight loss program. Not for the body
(though many of us might need that as well), but the spirit, as too many
people lug around excess baggage — and that’s not good for running a
race if you want to win.</p>
<p>In the first of our series on rest Christians miss because they carry
around excess baggage, consider the first verse of Hebrews.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>God, who at sundry times and in diverse manners spoke in time past
unto the fathers by the prophets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar to Moses writing in Genesis, Paul presents no arguments for
God’s existence, he simply assumes you understand. Unfortunately, man
attempts to satisfy his thirst for proving god exists with various
philosophical proofs, most of which fail to appease the god-denier.</p>
<p>If you’re trying to find rest in any of the following “proofs” for God,
you’ll discover the rest God wants you to have will forever elude you.</p>
<p><em>Ontological</em> — The argument states if you can imagine in your mind a
perfect, ultimate, greatest possible being — but that being didn’t exist
— then that being would <em>not</em> be perfect and ultimate, since it lacks a
trait (existence) without which it could not be said to be perfect. If
that sounds like philosophical mumbo-jumbo along the lines of asking how
many angels can dance on the head of a pin, yeah, it sounds that way to
me too, so we’ll move on.</p>
<p><em>Cosmological</em> — Since the universe exists, it must be caused by
something, and that something must be caused by something, and so on.
Eventually a first cause must exist, as an infinite chain of causes
can’t exist; that first cause is God.</p>
<p><em>Teleological</em> — The universe appears as an ordered, designed system,
thus it must have a designer. Design implies a designer; if you’re
handed a watch, you don’t believe it magically and spontaneously
appeared, you understand a team of engineers designed and built it, and
precision machinery constructed it. Similarly, the ordered universe must
have a designer, God.</p>
<p>The argument (while not a proof) certainly makes sense. Science and
other disciplines work because we inhabit an ordered and designed
universe.</p>
<p>If you purchased a computer program, would you think it resulted from
design, or chance? Obviously design, as we call random, non-designed
features in computer programs <em>bugs</em>. Nobody looks at a computer program
and believes it came from anything other than skillful and talented
programmers.</p>
<p>Yet when considering the universe, suddenly the atheist shifts thinking
— while not denying the designed nature of software, the atheist looks
at the ordered, designed universe and proclaims poof! This came from
nothing! No designer.</p>
<p><em>Transcendental</em> — An argument from morality and logic, which exist
universally <em>apart from the cosmos</em>. Those values existed before (and
will continue after), the universe exists. Again, this does not <em>prove</em>
God exists, but it does leave the atheist in a bit of a quandary. If no
god exists, how do you define morality? A question posed to Richard
Dawkins, whom you could call the father of modern atheism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What defines your morality?” I asked with genuine curiosity.</p>
<p>There was an extended pause as Dawkins considered the question
carefully. “Moral philosophic reasoning and a shifting zeitgeist.” … I
asked an obvious question: “As we speak of this shifting zeitgeist,
how are we to determine who’s right?” … “Yes, absolutely fascinating.”
His response was immediate. “What’s to prevent us from saying Hitler
wasn’t right? I mean, that is a genuinely difficult question. But
whatever [defines morality], it’s not the Bible …”</p>
<p>I was stupefied. He had readily conceded that his own philosophical
position did not offer a rational basis for moral judgments. His
intellectual honesty was refreshing, if somewhat disturbing on this
point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like the interviewer, we give Dawkins credit for admitting atheism
provides no rational basis for morality. What Dawkins describes yields
nothing more than majority rules (zeitgeist). That does not mean
atheists can’t <em>be</em> moral, or act in moral fashion, but atheism provides
no basis for morality.</p>
<p>Ultimately, morality comes from the God they seek to deny.</p>
<p>Are any philosophical arguments for god acceptable? Not really — if the
supernatural exists, it (by definition) can’t be deducted by ordinary
means, so attempts to prove the existence of God won’t be satisfactory.</p>
<p>You’re left with the basic quandary — you can’t prove or disprove God —
you can only examine evidence you do have, and arrive at a reasonable
conclusion. Either God exists, or we evolved from slime. You don’t get
another option. Unfortunately, evolution doesn’t work, as it violates
the laws of Physics, having no scientific evidence (that means
repeatable, published experimental evidence) for its foundations (matter
comes from nothing, non-living goo becomes alive, and so on).</p>
<p>The first rest required comes from page 1: “In the beginning God created
the heavens and the Earth.”</p>
<p>You might believe it, but do you rest in it?</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
