  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Today’s Christian requires a weight loss program. Not for the body
(though many of us might need that as well), but the spirit, as too many
people lug around excess baggage — and that’s not good for running a
race if you want to win.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/10/lose-the-weight-part-one.html">The first part of this series</a>
discussed various “proofs” for God, and why Christians shouldn’t bother
with them (lose the weight). In the second of our series we’ll touch on
a problem facing not just Christians but everyone: how can I see God?</p>
<p>Once again, back to Hebrews.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his
person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had
by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty
on high;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone wants to see god and be “spiritual,” with everyone pointing
this way to god, that way to god, I’m a guru and can really show you the
way. Yet those same gurus reject Jesus as creator and Lord, thus,
they’ll never find God as Jesus represents the express image of God.</p>
<p>In John 14, Phillip expresses the same problem everyone shares today
(nothing ever really changes, does it?). Frustrated, he said to Jesus
show us the Father, and that’s good enough for us. Jesus provides one of
those strange responses, saying if you’ve seen Me you’ve seen the
Father, why do you ask then to see the Father?</p>
<p>The second rest … if you’re struggling to find God, look to Jesus.</p>
<p>Paul mentions Jesus as “upholding all things by the word of his power,”
something quite similar to what he told the church at Colosse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consist in Greek means holding together, which may not mean much without
a sidebar on Physics. Recall your high school Physics? Sure you do …
inside the atom exist protons and neutrons. But wait, like charges
(protons) repel each other.</p>
<p>So what holds it together? Well, it’s something called the “strong
nuclear force.” Which is, as Paul told you, Jesus — right now Jesus
personally prevents each atom in the universe from flying apart.</p>
<p>Peter reminds us “the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and
the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works
that are therein shall be burned up.” What’s that? The biggest atom bomb
ever. An atomic weapon contains only a few pounds of material — can you
imagine the power released when the entire cosmos explodes? Of course,
that means it requires that much power to hold it together right now.</p>
<p>Second rest — looking for God and spirituality while ignoring Jesus
leads to futility. If you’re struggling right now, perhaps it’s because
you’re listening to spiritual gurus instead of they guy who wrote the
book and holds all things together.</p>
<p>It’s time to lose the weight and get in gear.</p>
<p>… because it’s 2:59 AM.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
