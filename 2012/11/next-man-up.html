<p>Oregon Football redefined the game. Not just for lightning quick scores,
up-tempo offense, and staggering point totals. The real difference comes
from Coach Kelly and his philosophy, one of those ideas being how to
handle individuals in a team game.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://oregonduckfootballnews.com/uncategorized/alonso-and-jordan-expected-to-return-to-oregon-defense-next-man-up-philosophy-a-valuable-role-in-team-success/" title="Oregon Football News">
<p>Chip Kelly’s mantra has always been – “next man up.” That’s how the Ducks practice and that’s the philosophy of this team. If a player goes down to injury, the next player in should be prepared – mentally and physically – to play.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coach Kelly <em>never</em> talks about injuries.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.registerguard.com/web/updates/28721464-55/boyett-ducks-saturday-kelly-oregon.html.csp" title="Register-Guard">
<p>“We don’t talk about it, ever,” said Kelly, whose team improved to 2–0. “We’re going next man in, if we have to go next man in.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While a team will have its star players, you don’t hear much from Coach
Kelly about it. If someone gets hurt, it’s not doom-and-gloom about the
season being over, rather it’s an opportunity for someone else to shine,
and contribute to the team.</p>
<p>Coach Kelly’s ideas certainly work for Oregon football, but you might be
asking yourself, what does this have to do with me? Consider the words
of Coach Paul:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have been believers so long now that you ought to be teaching
others. Instead, you need someone to teach you again the basic things
about God’s word. You are like babies who need milk and cannot eat
solid food. (Hebrews 5:12 NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s rephrase Paul’s words in Chip Kelly terms: You guys aren’t ready
to be next man up. If a teammate goes down, you must be ready, or the
team suffers. It’s time to step up (or as I say, it’s 2:59AM) and <a href="https://framesofreferencellc.com/catalog/9780983111733/">get back in the game</a>.</p>
<p>Chip Kelly’s philosophy has proved to be correct as the Ducks look to
extend their <del>PAC-10</del> <ins>PAC-12</ins> dominance yet another season.</p>
<p>Sadly, the difference between football and the church comes down to
dedication — while football players prioritize team, working in the
weight room, and practice, the church argues over which is the bigger
problem, ignorance or apathy? (With the answer “I don’t know, and I
don’t care”)</p>
<p>Apparently it’s too much for the church to be at least as dedicated as a
football team, as the church can be infested with slackers and
pew-warmers.</p>
<p>How about you — if someone in your church leadership goes down, are you
prepared to be next man in?</p>
<p>You must listen to Coach Paul … because it’s 2:59AM, and you <em>can</em> do
it, but to do it you’ve got to get off the bench and get in the box.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Gibson's_1988_World_Series_home_run">
<p> … the crowd on its feet and if there was ever a preface, to “Casey at the Bat,” it would have to be the ninth inning. Two out. The tying run aboard, the winning run at the plate, and Kirk Gibson, standing at the plate. Gibson, a deep sigh … re-gripping the bat … shoulders just shrugged … now goes to the top of the helmet, as he always does … steps in with that left foot.</p>
<p>Eckersley working out of the stretch, here’s the three-two pitch … and a drive hit to right field WAY BACK! IT’S GONE! IT’S GONE! (Don Drysdale calling Kirk Gibson’s ninth-inning home run in the 1988 World Series)</p>
</blockquote>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
