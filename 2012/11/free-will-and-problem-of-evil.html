<p>In a previous article on <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/11/problem-of-evil.html">the problem of evil</a> we
discussed the hubris of the person attempting to attribute to themselves
all knowledge — as if <em>they</em> don’t understand why God acts the way He
does, it doesn’t make any sense at all. Naturally, the only way that
logic works is if the person possesses all knowledge themselves — making
themselves into a sort of Deity.<br />
And the last thing the atheist wants to do is acknowledge the existence
of God (even if it’s themselves).</p>
<p>Thus, their argument on the problem of evil falls apart <em>logically</em>,
without even considering the <em>substance</em> of their argument. But let’s
consider a different angle to the problem, and this time we’ll use a
slightly longer version of the same argument on the problem of evil.</p>
<p>Before we begin, we’ll deal with one other issue, that of God creating
evil. Since evil exists, and God created everything, God created evil.
That’s not true; for the reasons see the article <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/11/did-god-create-evil.html">did God create evil</a> for
the answer — we’ll not derail this discussion for that sidebar.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>God exists</li>
<li>God is omnipotent, omniscient, and perfectly good</li>
<li>A perfectly good being would want to prevent all evils.</li>
<li>An omniscient being knows every way in which evils can come into
existence.</li>
<li>An omnipotent being who knows every way in which an evil can come
into existence has the power to prevent that evil from coming into
existence.</li>
<li><strong>A being who knows every way in which an evil can come into
existence, who is able to prevent that evil from coming into
existence, and who wants to do so, would prevent the existence of
that evil.</strong></li>
<li>If there exists an omnipotent, omniscient, and perfectly good
being, then no evil exists.</li>
<li>Evil exists (logical contradiction).</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Step number six causes the problem. For if an all-knowing, all-powerful,
all-loving God has some reason to allow evil to exist, the argument
falls apart. So what possible reason could a God of that nature have to
allow evil to exist? In other words, why not create a cosmos where no
one has the possibility to do evil? Why not create a utopia where we all
live happily ever after?</p>
<p>Free will.</p>
<p>It’s that simple. Sure, God <em>could</em> create a cosmos where you had no
choice but to follow Him and live in His presence, but if such a
universe existed the (potential) atheist would be the first to shake
their fist at God and proclaim “you gave me no choice — that’s not
fair!” And he’d be right — forced love is rape.</p>
<p>So God gives you a choice, you can do good or evil, accept Him or reject
Him, live in heaven or not. It’s all your choice. But by God allowing
you to make that free will choice, it also means you have the capability
to choose poorly, or do evil things.</p>
<p>Yet God respects your choice and does not force Himself on anyone. If
you don’t want Him, fine. If you do, fine. You’re a free agent and can
choose your own destiny. So yes, God <em>could</em> prevent you from doing
evil, but then you’d be nothing but a puppet. So God allows you to
choose, knowing some will choose Him, others won’t.</p>
<p>What could be more reasonable than being pro-choice?</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
