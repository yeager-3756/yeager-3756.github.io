  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>I’d like to thank my loyal subscribers for staying with me. I had
planned to continue with my series “Physics and the Bible” but sometimes
life intervenes and things don’t go as planned; our series will continue
next week.</p>
<p>My dog died Sunday, and I just don’t feel much like writing.</p>
<p>Sure, she was 16 years old, frankly longer than a Dachshund should live,
and we all knew everyday she woke up was another gift from God, but
still, the loss of a dog is #2 on the <a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2008/06/19/when-is-it-okay-for-a-man-to-cry/">when is it okay for a man to cry</a>
list (and well, I didn’t sleep much either, and neither did my other
dog).</p>
<p>But as I’ve always said, we’re not much for news around here, we’re more
interested in what we can learn from it. I’m fairly confident most
people aren’t really interested in my dog, but they might be interested
in a new emphasis on an old idea.</p>
<h2>Pardon the Interruption</h2>
<p>Okay, allow me to share one thing from my dog before we move on (sort of
a eulogy, you might say). In one of my books I wrote about how much you
can learn from your dog, so allow me to wander down memory lane a bit,
and then we’ll get to the point — I promise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we brought home our puppy our backyard was a mess — the fence
needed repair and nearly toppled over on its own. To prevent the puppy
escaping from the yard and running out into the street in front of a
car the fence needed repair, which we diligently set out to do.</p>
<p>Dachshunds are social creatures, they like to remain with their family
so we had a problem — we needed to fix the fence, yet the puppy wanted
to stay with us while we worked. In an attempt to remedy the
situation, we set up a portable kennel on the patio while we worked
repairing the fence. And you know what comes next…</p>
<p>Yap, yap, yap. Bark, bark, bark. Whine, whine, whine. Yap, bark, whine
… (you get the idea).</p>
<p>The puppy simply wouldn’t remain quiet. I thought, you don’t
understand, the fence needs to be fixed so you won’t run out into the
street and get squished by a car (the dog only being 8 inches tall you
know). It’s for <em>your</em> benefit, just wait and it will be better soon.
But try as I could, the dog didn’t understand — yap, yap, yap, bark,
bark, bark. And then the Lord responded…</p>
<p><em>You’re the dog</em>.</p>
<p>To which I quickly replied — yap, yap, yap. Bark, bark, bark. Whine,
whine, whine…</p>
<p>You may not see the final plan; you may <em>never</em> see the final plan.
That doesn’t mean God doesn’t have one, and it’s better than the one
you thought up. Don’t be the dog yapping along complaining about
something you know nothing about as you see through the glass darkly.
(”<a href="https://framesofreferencellc.com/catalog/9780983111702/">The Troubled Church</a>”, page 145–146)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks girl, may the lessons you taught never be forgotten. You will be
missed.</p>
<h2>The Origin of Death</h2>
<p>I watched my dog get old, and slowly begin to shut down, a product of
decay and simply old age. That’s when it hit me: <strong>Satan stinks — <em>You
took my dog, you sick bastard</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Oh, not directly (unless something was going on I didn’t know about),
but he’s responsible nonetheless. Allow me to paraphrase.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the fifth day God created Dachshunds, and all manner of dogs, along
with everything that swims in the river, different kinds of birds, and
each produced many offspring, <strong>and God saw that that they were
good</strong>. (Genesis 1:21, Yeager translation)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God loves dogs, and if a bird can’t fall to the ground without His
knowledge, surely He looks after His creation as well (we’ll come back
to that in a second, or as Paul Harvey would say, you’ll get <em>the rest
of the story</em>).</p>
<p>Of course, you’ve heard the phrase “no good deed goes unpunished”, so
cue the creepy music as the evil villain enters the scene.</p>
<p>Once again, from my own paraphrase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now the snake was more cunning and deceitful than any family-friendly
pet which God had made, and he slithered up to the woman and said “Did
God say you shall not eat of any tree?” And the woman said “we shalt
not eat of the tree in the middle of the garden, lest entropy and
decay enter the cosmos, and we die”. Then the slimy snake lied to her
face saying, “you shall not die” …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, you know the rest of the story, but it ends thousands of years
later with <strong>You took my dog, you sick bastard</strong>.</p>
<p>The physicist in me understands what happened — entropy entered into the
world, better known as decay, death, and sin. A dog isn’t supposed to
live 16 years; mine did. Still, it’s sad to watch the end.</p>
<p>I could go on for hours delving into that, but it’s much easier to say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You took my dog, you sick bastard.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The (kind of) Happy Ending</h2>
<p>God does look after His creation, for you see we were scheduled to be
out of town this weekend, but had to cancel for other reasons. Perhaps
it’s reading too many Navy Seal books, but I’m of the thought no dog
should die alone, they should be with their family when they pass.</p>
<p>Mine was.</p>
<p>And that, as Paul Harvey would say, is the rest of the story.</p>
<h2>So What?</h2>
<p>Chuck Missler said you can measure your spiritual maturity by asking
“How much do you hate sin?” I awoke today (well, not really awoke
because that implies sleep) with a new understanding of the pain and
anguish God must feel over His creation tormented by entropy (death,
decay).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You took my dog, you sick bastard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sin and satan stink, because they conspired with malice, forethought,
and hate to take my dog — and everything before, as well as what will
come after.</p>
<p>Yeah, he took my dog, but he can’t win, <em>and he knows it</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Satan (who deceived mankind and caused death) was thrown into the lake
of fire where his cohorts are. And they will stay there forever, never
to hurt another puppy ever again. (Revelation 20:10 YT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Checkmate. Game, set, match. The fat lady sung. <strong>Hasta la vista,
baby</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the
first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. Then I, John,
saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,
prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice
from heaven saying, “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He
will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will
be with them and be their God. And God will wipe away every tear from
their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying.
There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.”
Then He who sat on the throne said, “Behold, I make all things new.”
And He said to me, “Write, for these words are true and faithful.” And
He said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the
Beginning and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of
life freely to him who thirsts.” (Revelation 21:1-6 NKJV)</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
