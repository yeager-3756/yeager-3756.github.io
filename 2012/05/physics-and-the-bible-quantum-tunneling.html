  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>I’ve said to understand your Bible you must understand Physics. Yes, you
don’t necessarily <em>have</em> to, but frequently some basic understanding of
Physics clears up controversy or provides insight. Don’t worry, we won’t
be delving too much into areas you haven’t heard of as we’re interested
in application of the Bible, not science for science sake.</p>
<p>In part II of this series, we’ll consider a passage in Zechariah, and
how Quantum Tunneling provides insight into the Biblical text.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who art thou, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a
plain; and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings,
crying, Grace, grace unto it. (Zechariah 4:7)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Quantum Tunneling</h2>
<p><a href="http://abyss.uoregon.edu/%7Ejs/glossary/quantum_tunneling.html">Quantum tunneling</a>
is a principle in Physics where an entity lacking sufficient energy to
cross a barrier somehow finds itself on the other side.</p>
<p>Think of it as if you were trying to roll a bowling ball over Mount
Everest. You certainly could not roll the ball hard enough to get it up
and over, yet your friend on the other side of the mountain somehow
finds the ball on the other side. It “tunneled” through as it lacked the
ability to roll over.</p>
<p>Change the previous paragraph with some technical jargon and you’ve got
Quantum Tunneling.</p>
<h2>So What?</h2>
<p>Look at the passage in Zechariah again — the mountain becomes a plain
before the Lord. What is that a description of? Zerubbabel sees a
mountain before him as he’s rebuilding the temple. But from the Lord’s
view? No big deal, the mountains Zerubbabel sees are from his resources
and strength; the previous verse reminds Zerubbabel where the power
<em>really</em> comes from.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the
LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my
spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using our skills and ideas, we see a huge mountain. But when we rely on
the Lord? Nothing but a flat plain.</p>
<p>Do you have mountains in your life — areas you believe you lack the
ability to get over or conquer? Perhaps it’s time to take the word of
the Lord to Zerubbabel and apply it to your life. It’s not by your
education, money, fame or anything else, only by the Lord’s spirit.</p>
<p>It’s perspective. Many times we see huge mountains in our lives, yet to
God they’re nothing but flat plains.</p>
<p>This and much more is in our latest book “Get Back in the Game: Living
Where the Rubber Meets the Road”, available at
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0983111731/">Amazon.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/get-back-in-the-game-darrin-yeager/1110207673?ean=9780983111733">Barnes &amp; Noble</a>,
and just about everywhere else. Amazon has some stocking issues right
now, but it’s in stock at Barnes &amp; Noble.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
