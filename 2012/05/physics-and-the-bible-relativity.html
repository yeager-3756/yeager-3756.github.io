  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>In the final part of this series, we’ll consider Einstein’s Relativity,
and finally put to rest one of the oldest controversies in the Bible
(but you’ll have to wait until the end).</p>
<h2>Relativity</h2>
<p>What is relativity? Simply stated, <strong>time and events are not absolute</strong>,
they can only be interpreted from a specific point of view. For example,
suppose you watched a lightning storm from your window, and you see two
lightning strikes hit different points on the ground at the same time.</p>
<p>Would it surprise you to learn someone else may <em>not</em> see those as
simultaneous events?</p>
<p>Wait a minute, you say. They either did or didn’t hit the ground at the
same time. As Lee Corso says “not so fast, my friend.” You can’t answer
the question absolutely, <em>only by a specific person’s frame of
reference</em> — movement and gravity relative to other objects will affect
the notion of simultaneous events.</p>
<p>When I was in Physics class we’d perform some calculations involving
time, and of course arrive at two different answers. Inevitably some
person would raise their hand and ask “which one is correct?” at which
point my professor would grin widely and say, “it’s all relative — see,
Relativity isn’t that hard.”</p>
<p><strong>It’s a tough concept to wrap your arms around</strong> — the fact time and
the idea of simultaneous events is <em>not</em> absolute. The only thing you
can say for sure is in some reference, they were or were not.</p>
<p>We’ll not cover the minute details of relativity, the important (and
difficult) idea is time itself is not absolute, it only can be
interpreted by a specific reference frame.</p>
<h3>Example One: How old is the Universe?</h3>
<p>Where does this come up? You might have heard the debate about the age
of the universe, with some claiming billions of years, others 7 days, as
Genesis says. Which is right? You can’t answer the question without
knowing what reference frame you’re talking about.</p>
<p>One thing is clear, from God’s point of view, creation <em>was</em> in just six
(24-hour) days. While it’s true the Hebrew in Genesis <em>could</em> imply
ages, that’s not the only place creation is spoken of.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work. But the seventh day is
the sabbath of the LORD thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work,
thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy
maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy
gates. For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and
all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD
blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. (Exodus 20:9–11)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exodus speaks of a normal seven-day week we’re used to, but associates
that with creation, so it’s obvious <strong>creation was six 24-hour days</strong> as
we’re used to, not ages or billions of years.</p>
<p>We’ve covered relativity in our article <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/01/frames-reference.html">Frames of Reference</a>.
For those interested in more detail please refer to it.</p>
<h2>So What? Example Two: Calvinism vs Arminianism</h2>
<p>Okay, you all stuck with us for the big finale, right?</p>
<p>What does relativity imply for the Bible? Let’s solve a great debate in
the church — <strong>God’s predestination versus man’s free will</strong>. Which is
“right”? By now you know the answer — they both are! It all depends on
your frame of reference.</p>
<p>Consider the two extremes of those ideas.</p>
<p>First, suppose man has ultimate free will, in fact, God barely knows
what’s going on, and certainly can’t do much about it. When I get out of
bed in the morning, what eternal question am I faced with?</p>
<p>Fruit Loops or Corn Flakes?</p>
<p>Now consider the other extreme. God pulls your strings, like working a
giant puppet. You have no choice at all in anything, as God controls
every aspect of your life. When I get out of bed in the morning, what
eternal question am I faced with?</p>
<p>Fruit Loops or Corn Flakes?</p>
<p>Obviously, from <em>man’s</em> point of view, we have free will. It matters not
if we do or do not actually have it, <em>we must act as if we do, because
that’s our frame of reference</em>.</p>
<p>I’d also submit a supreme, all-powerful, all-knowing God is in charge,
or in His reference frame, everything is ultimately going the way He
wants it — after all, it’s His sandbox.</p>
<p>I hear the heckler in the front row — “Sure, but is that in the Bible,
or did you just make it up?”</p>
<p>Consider John’s Gospel, as he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All that the Father giveth me shall come to me</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah HA! The Calvinist proclaims. You have no choice! It’s God all the
way. But keep reading in John:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah HA! The Arminianist proclaims. It’s up to <em>you</em>. You’re responsible.</p>
<p>Of course, the kicker to this little problem is both ideas come from a
<em>single</em> verse in John (6:37). Which is “right”? They both are — it all
depends on your frame of reference.</p>
<p>Once again, your knowledge of Physics provides insight into the Bible;
in this case solving once and for all a debate which splits churches and
pits Christian against Christian.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
