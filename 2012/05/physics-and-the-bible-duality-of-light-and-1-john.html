  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>I’ve said many times to understand your Bible you must understand
Physics. Yes, you don’t necessarily <em>have</em> to, but many times some basic
understanding of Physics clears up controversy or provides insight.
Don’t worry, we won’t be delving too much into long technical
discussions as we’re interested in application of the Bible, not science
for science sake.</p>
<p>In part I of this series, we’ll consider a passage in 1 John — perhaps
one of the most troubling in the Bible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto
you, that <strong>God is light</strong>, and in him is no darkness at all (1 John
1:5).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most people don’t see a problem with that, unless you’ve heard of the
following…</p>
<h2>Wave-Particle Duality of Light</h2>
<p>We’re all familiar with light acting as a wave, like when you throw a
rock in a pool. You can see the pattern, and a wave bouncing off a side
will interfere with other waves as it travels back.</p>
<p>If you’ve watched Star Trek at all, it seems just about every episode
has the phrase “load photon torpedoes” — a photon is a particle of light
(the Star Trek weapon didn’t seem to use actual photons, but I’m not a
Trekkie interested in fictional technology). Light can also exist as a
particle, like a golf ball. If you’ve played in those boxes filled with
balls, you see an entirely different set of rules at work.</p>
<p>Light exists with dual-properties. Experiments with light can obtain
either the wave nature, or the particle nature, but not both at the same
time; light exists as two-in-one — two natures together, yet distinct.</p>
<p>Note: for those interested in details, look up the two-slit experiment
with light and you’ll find plenty to occupy your time.</p>
<h2>Keeping Awake at Night</h2>
<p>Now you see that problem, God <em>is</em> light — not light-like, not having
the characteristics of light. If God is a trinity (and He is), and light
exists as a duality (and it does), Houston, we’ve got a problem.</p>
<p>The passage causing sleepless nights, in Greek:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>θεός ἐστί φῶς (theos esti phōs, or God is light)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You’ll find it’s translated correctly, God is Light, so the problem
isn’t in translation.</p>
<p>What do we do? If the Bible is inerrant (and it is), and the
wave-particle duality of light is true (and it is), how do we solve the
apparent inherit contradiction between duality and trinity? As always,
the answer appears elsewhere in the Bible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But when the Helper comes, whom I shall send to you from the Father,
the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, He will testify of
Me. (John 15:26 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s the answer. The Holy Spirit doesn’t speak of Himself, only of
Jesus.</p>
<p>It will turn out light does actually have three properties, but the
third will only be observable by indirect means, because under
experimental conditions it looks like either a wave or particle — as
John wrote the Holy Spirit will testify of Jesus.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
