  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Way back — a decade ago — when the events of September 11th were still
fresh, everyone waited for the President’s State of the Union speech.
What would he say? How would he handle tragedy? During the State of the
Union speech, he said the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve come to know truths that we will never question: Evil is real,
and it must be opposed … In a single instant, we realized that this
will be a decisive decade in the history of liberty, that we’ve been
called to a unique role in human events. Rarely has the world faced a
choice more clear or consequential. (State of the Union, Jan 29, 2002)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stunning admission. If you recall the speech, you also note between then
and now attitudes have shifted a bit. The admission evil exists was …
ummm … softened a bit as you hear strategies like “dialog” and
“understand” instead of admitting evil exists and must be met in combat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Toto, I’ve a feeling we’re not in Kansas any more. (“The Wizard of Oz”)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Soon after the media frenzy wears off, people return to Oz thinking evil
doesn’t exist and they can click their heals and make it go away, or it
can be understood and rehabilitated. Nonsense. It’s pathetic such
obvious truth needs to be stated, but too many ignore plain truth and
accept lies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Listen, and understand. That terminator is out there. It can’t be
bargained with. It can’t be reasoned with. It doesn’t feel pity, or
remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are
dead. (Kyle Reese, “The Terminator” 1984)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s the mind of evil. It exists. It won’t quit. It fails to respond
to reason. It seeks to destroy you.</p>
<p>Only two options exist: resist, or be destroyed.</p>
<p>The first step to getting better is admitting you have a problem. In
this case, a <em>reality</em> problem.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/11/free-will-and-problem-of-evil.html">Evil exits</a>.
Evil people exist. Those <em>must</em> be opposed. It’s not the gun’s fault,
societies fault, or their parents fault. Yet <strong>delusional people believe
if we ban this or regulate that, we’ll find ourselves in utopia</strong> where
everyone gets a pony. Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Some people are simply evil, and will do evil things <em>unless they’re
stopped</em>. They’ll use guns, knives, fertilizer, cars, baseball bats,
crowbars, bare hands, anything.</p>
<p>Satan and his evil minions will <em>never</em> stop. It’s not their nature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Wyatt Earp</em>: What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the
things he does?</p>
<p><em>Doc Holliday</em>: A man like Ringo has a great empty hole through the
middle of him. He can never kill enough, or steal enough, or inflict
enough pain to ever fill it.</p>
<p><em>Wyatt Earp</em>: What does he need?</p>
<p><em>Doc Holliday</em>: Revenge.</p>
<p><em>Wyatt Earp</em>: For what?</p>
<p><em>Doc Holliday</em>: Being born. (“Tombstone”, 1993)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evil exists. It’s a <em>choice</em> people make. The more society shifts blame
elsewhere and ignores the undeniable fact evil exists, the more evil
will prosper. <strong>You can’t defeat the enemy unless you know who and what
the enemy is</strong>.</p>
<p>The church suffers the same delusion. Satan isn’t real. Cults need to be
“understood.” Let’s welcome heresy (aka <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">social justice</a>,
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/05/church-common-good.html">common good</a>,
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/03/heresy-replacement-theology.html">replacement theology</a>,
the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/11/the-bizarreness-of-the-big-tent.html">big tent</a>)
in the name of being “open,” after all, we don’t want to offend anyone
with truth, right? Better to stick your fingers in your ears and say
la-la-la I can’t hear you.</p>
<p>Denying reality isn’t a strategy, it’s a guaranteed one-way ticket to
defeat. Of course, some would <em>rather</em> be uniformed and remain in the
comfort of their delusion and denial of reality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like everyone else, you were born into bondage, born into a prison
that you cannot smell or taste or touch. A prison for your mind.
Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see
it for yourself … You take the blue pill, the story ends, you wake up
in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red
pill, you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole
goes. (Morpheus, “The Matrix”, 1999)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s time to acknowledge the truth of what the President said:</p>
<p><strong>Evil is real, and it must be opposed.</strong></p>
<p>You can accept that reality, or return to living in deception and
delusion. Your choice. Only yours. But remember truth cares not if you
believe it or not — reality remains the same.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All I’m offering is the truth. Nothing more. (Morpheus, “The Matrix”, 1999)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ignore reality at your own peril, because (as John Loeffler says) <strong>your
failure to be informed does not make me a wacko</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hasta la vista, baby.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next week, we’ll tackle the problem facing many people — what do you do
when evil appears to win? What do you do when you’re mad at God? What
course do you set when it appears everything is against you?</p>
<p>The answer echoes from December 1944.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
