  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Let’s consider a front-page problem today — Social Security as part of
the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/04/increasing-federal-deficit.html">Federal government deficit</a>.
The <strong>discussion illustrates something vital in your spiritual life —
understanding truth-lies</strong> and the methods people use to deceive you
(even in the so-called Christian church).</p>
<p>Deception infects much more than politics as the church falls for the
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/03/atheism-poison-liberal-theology.html">poison of liberal theology</a>;
understanding truth-lies and logic will become essential to your
well-being. <strong>It’s not only a political issue, but spiritual as well</strong>
as the current discussion over Social Security provides another example
of the importance of logic and critical thinking.</p>
<p>Don’t fall for tricks John Loeffler calls “truth-lies” — something which
might be technically true, but used to deceive or give a false
impression.</p>
<p>You’ve heard politicians boldly proclaim Social Security isn’t part of
the deficit, and shouldn’t be involved in deficit reduction discussions.
Is this true? The CBO says about the Social Security “trust funds”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… certain taxes—especially payroll taxes for Social Security and
Medicare, which are credited to those trust funds—may lead taxpayers
to believe that they have paid for future benefits. Trust funds can be
useful mechanisms for monitoring the balance between earmarked
receipts and a program’s spending, but they are basically an
accounting device, and <strong>their balances, even if “invested” in
Treasury securities, provide no resources to the government for
meeting future funding commitments</strong>. When those payments come due,
the <strong>government must finance them in the same way that it finances
other commitments—through taxes or borrowing from the public</strong>. (CBO
paper “Measures of the US Government’s Fiscal Position Under Current
Law”, September 2004, page xi)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s like you wrote yourself a check for $1,000,000 and said “look how
rich I am!” Of course, actually <em>cashing</em> that check means you have to
get the money from somewhere — borrow it or earn it.</p>
<p>The same with Social Security. The so-called trust fund contains nothing
but IOUs (Treasury Bonds). When Social Security cashes the bonds the
Federal government must borrow or raise taxes to pay for it — exactly as
the government’s own CBO states.</p>
<p>The “surplus” of Social Security has been taken by the government and
spent. <strong>There is no surplus, trust fund, or savings</strong> of any kind, and
when the bill comes due, one or more things <em>will</em> happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>Borrowing to continue massive Federal deficits.</li>
<li>Massive tax increases to pay entitlement benefits.</li>
<li>Huge inflation of the currency (aka <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/11/buzzword-alert-quantitative-easing.html">Quantitative Easing</a>).</li>
<li>Failure to pay Social Security promises.</li>
</ol>
<p>That day comes <em>very</em> soon — as soon as Social Security taxes fail to
pay for current benefits (negative cash flow, or paying more in benefits
than taken in in taxes). As it descends deeper and deeper into red ink,
those tax increases/benefit cuts/deficits/inflation will become
stunningly large.</p>
<p>There is no <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/08/what-you-need-know-about-free-lunch.html">free lunch</a>,
contrary to how you’ve been lied to by the Administration and Congress
who believe they can continue to spend your money without limit, and the
bill won’t come due.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“My dear guests, I am Mr. Roarke, your host. Welcome to Fantasy
Island!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar to the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/06/truth-lie-myth-surplus.html">myth of the Clinton budget surplus</a>
(which surplus never existed), or the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/06/truth-lie-stimulus-jobs-saved-or-created.html">myth stimulus creates jobs</a>
this myth has a <em>small</em> element of truth to it (a trust fund exists),
but it’s only used to deceive people into believing something which
<em>isn’t</em> true (Social Security can use that fund to pay benefits without
increasing taxes or borrowing).</p>
<p>It’s a “truth-lie.” Yes, technically it’s true Social Security has a
fund, but it holds government IOUs (Treasury Bonds), which means when
Social Security needs those funds to pay benefits — surprise! — those
funds will come from borrowing, raising taxes, or inflation.</p>
<p><strong>Anyone believing otherwise hasn’t done their homework</strong>.</p>
<p>Deception infects the church as well, as some claim <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">the gospel of social justice</a>,
ignore <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/06/red-letter-christianity-clueless-about-sin.html">what sin is</a>,
believe the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/05/church-common-good.html">church exists for the common good</a>, or
spread heresy like <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/03/heresy-replacement-theology.html">replacement theology</a>.</p>
<p><em>All</em> wrong. <em>All</em> deception. <em>All</em> easily cast off by those who study
their Bible seriously.</p>
<p>Beware the truth-lie. Do your homework. Don’t be deceived.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
