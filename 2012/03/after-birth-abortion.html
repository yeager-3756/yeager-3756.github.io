  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Abortion will always remain a hot-button topic because it isn’t possible
to craft a compromise. You either terminate a pregnancy or you don’t. No
middle ground can exist. However, the “Journal of Medical Ethics” came
up with A Modest Proposal concerning babies with Down’s syndrome or
other problems.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2012/02/22/medethics-2011-100411.full">
<p>… to <b>bring up such children might be an unbearable burden on</b> the family and on <b>society as a whole, when the state economically provides for their care</b>. … Therefore, we argue that, when circumstances occur after birth such that they would have justified abortion, what we call after-birth abortion should be permissible.</p>
<p>In spite of the oxymoron in the expression, we propose to call this practice ‘after-birth abortion’, rather than ‘infanticide’, to <span class="sic">emphasise</span> that the moral status of the individual killed is comparable with that of a fetus …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They’re redefining terms in classic
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/11/post-modern-philosophy-church.html">post-modern</a>
style — it’s not infanticide (or murder), it’s just an abortion. If the
life (in their opinion) isn’t worth it, snuff it out.</p>
<p>Note the argument: when the government pays for medical care, they have
the <em>right</em> to kill anyone they feel is a burden. Remember this with
nationalized healthcare (aka Obamacare) — <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/08/what-you-need-know-about-free-lunch.html">there is no free
lunch</a>
— you’re trading your life for $$$.</p>
<p>The Journal should have the guts and honesty to call their idea for what
it is — <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan&#x27;s_Run">Logan’s Run</a>; the
kill-em-if-they’re-not-useful idea isn’t new, and results when you
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/06/more-dawkins-morality-no-absolutes.html">abandon absolute morality</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can’t justify your existence, if you’re not pulling your weight
in the social boat, if you’re not producing as much as you consume or
perhaps a little more, then, clearly, we cannot use the organizations
of our society for the purpose of keeping you alive, because your life
does not benefit us and it can’t be of very much use to yourself.
(George Bernard Shaw)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the elites who want to control everything because they think they’re
better than you, it’s not sanctity of life, it’s quality of life <em>as
they define it</em>.</p>
<p>It’s just a logical progression of abortion — it’s okay to terminate a
baby because it has some “defect” according to a group, or the baby
isn’t economically worth it. So what’s the difference between second
trimester and after birth? None, says the Journal.</p>
<p>Of course this applies to grandma as well. Not pulling your weight? Have
a doctor — under authority of government — terminate grandma. <em>It’s the
same argument as with the baby</em>, and it’s just as repulsive.</p>
<p>That’s where we’re headed folks as a logical extension of abortion.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.brockpress.com/news/external-news/court-considers-euthanasia-case-1.2714146" title="Brock Press">
<p>Many people in Holland, not just the elderly, have felt compelled to carry around “Do not kill me” cards in their wallets should they be in an accident.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Netherlands now has <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/mar/01/dutch-mobile-euthanasia-units">traveling euthanasia trucks</a>
who will kill you for free — because, you know, you’re a burden on
society and not pulling your weight. And if the government pays for your
medical care, they have a vested financial interest in your untimely
demise to save money to pay for the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/04/increasing-federal-deficit.html">massive debt</a>
they’ve racked up.</p>
<p>That’s the future when you abandon the sanctity of life because you’re
an “unbearable burden on society”, as the Journal says.</p>
<p>Scary times when you can’t trust doctors not to kill your child,
yourself, or grandma. What happened to “do no harm”? It appears the
handicapped, sick, and elderly have the same moral status as that of an
unborn child — kill ’em at will.</p>
<p>Why not? Well, read <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/fight-for-your-ideas/">Jon Morrow’s story</a> for starters — we’ll have more on him next week.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
equal, that <strong>they are endowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable Rights</strong>, that among these are Life, Liberty and the
pursuit of Happiness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>… self-evident except to medical ethics and pro-abortion people —
God-given rights only apply if the government’s death panel allows you
to live; I hope those denying God-given rights have a change of
underwear when they <em>do</em> meet God.</p>
<p><strong>CLEAN-UP ON AISLE 6!</strong></p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
