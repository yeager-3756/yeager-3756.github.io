  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>I’m finishing up my latest book, called “Get Back in the Game”, which
should be available in a few weeks at Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, and
elsewhere. It’s about Christians getting off the sidelines, as
Christianity is a full-contact life, not a spectator one.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, too many Christians are woefully unprepared for a
full-contact life, as I wrote in the introduction of the book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For far too long I’ve seen Christians slaughtered like pigs from a
lack of preparedness when trouble arrives, and I’m tired of watching.
It’s time to <em>do</em> something about it. If you’re bringing
(metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve only set yourself up
as a pig going to the slaughter (put that image firmly in your mind,
because we’ll come back to it. A lot).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simply put, if you’re in a trial, if one of your kids has gone sideways,
if you’re praying for healing, restoration, a job, or anything else, you
<em>will</em> come to the point of discouragement, despair, frustration, and a
point where you want to quit. Believe me, I’ve been there — more than
once or twice.</p>
<p>So here’s the final chapter in the book:</p>
<h2>Epilogue from “Get Back in the Game”</h2>
<p>While preparing final edits an unexpected event occurred — I broke my
arm during Taekwondo practice. Remember when I said to be prepared as in
sparring you’ll get dinged? Yep, I didn’t make that up; I speak from
experience. During a match I zigged when I should have zagged, and the
net result is my arm ended up in multiple pieces (and two is not better
than one when you’re talking about an arm bone).</p>
<p>That was practice, and while it’s not fun in any way, it will provide
lessons (besides learning to type left-handed as I’m typing this last
chapter) I’ll likely require later. When that bone broke I felt searing
pain that took my breath away for an instant. A few seconds later I
regained my composure and finished the match — I’ll leave it to others
to decide if that was wise or not.</p>
<p>In that few seconds (which seemed like minutes) an amazing amount of
brain activity went on, but I’ll boil it down to the essence — every
atom of my body screamed quit! Go down! Take a break! Give in.</p>
<p>I’ve said martial arts relates to your Christian life and it does. When
you’re in a trial, or praying for your child who’s gone sideways, or
imploring God for a healing, you’ll definitely come to the point when
every fiber of your being screams give in and quit.</p>
<p>I’m quite sure Job felt that way, and his problems had nothing to do
with him at all. Paul definitely did, telling the church at Corinth he
despaired even of life, while Elijah became afraid after defeating the
prophets of Baal at Mount Carmel.</p>
<p>Think you’re all alone when you feel that way? <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/10/you-are-never-alone.html">Think again</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/12/danger-religion-feelings.html">We’ve failed as a church to prepare people</a>
for the events we <em>know</em> will occur. Thus, when people face trials and
can’t figure out why, or they get smacked in the face by the enemy for
the first time they fold like a cheap lawn chair. Why? Pastors and
teachers gave a phony happy-land view of Christianity where everyone
gets a pony.</p>
<p>Living in The Matrix, they are. The question remains on the last page as
the first — do you want out of the phony existence many people are
trapped in? Are you prepared as a soldier of God?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmovable, always
abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your
labor is not in vain in the Lord.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Christian life is (and always will be) a full-contact sport. Get
back in the game!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Getting knocked down in life is a given; getting up and moving forward
is a choice. (Zig Ziglar “Born to Win”, page 79)</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
