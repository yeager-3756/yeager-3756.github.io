  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Everyone seems to have their own lens or filter used to interpret the
Bible. Post-modern, red-letter, social justice, emerging, and so on.
However, many of these miss rule zero of Bible interpretation, and if
you read pages of their ideas you might buy the manure they’re shoveling
… until you realize it violates rule zero.</p>
<h2>Example — Christ Centered</h2>
<p>A good example of something which sounds good, but eventually leads
astray, comes from blogger Rachel Evans’ review of Christian Smith’s
book “The Bible Made Impossible”.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://rachelheldevans.com/christocentric-hermeneutic-bible-impossible" title="Rachel Held Evans">
<p>Smith begins his exploration of a Christcentric hermeneutic in Chapter 5 by arguing that a truly evangelical reading of Scripture always filters Scripture “through the single lens of the gospel of Christ.”</p>
<p>In fact, according to Smith, “the purpose, center, and interpretive key to scripture is Jesus Christ. … It is not the words of the Bible that are ‘the way, the truth, and the life,” he writes, “It is the person of Christ, to whom the Bible witnesses.” (p. 99)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds good, right? We don’t worship the Bible, but the God revealed
<em>in</em> the Bible.</p>
<p>Like most strange ideas, it has some truth to it — but mix 98% Kool-aid
with 2% cyanide and you’re still dead.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals Jesus to be sure — from genealogies in Genesis 5 to
the cities of refuge, the whole Bible involves Him. But when you abandon
the clear written Word for a concept like “through the single lens of
the gospel of Christ” you create at least two problems.</p>
<ol>
<li>What do you do with people using <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">false substitute gospels</a>?</li>
<li>How do you define the gospel?</li>
</ol>
<p>This creates a chicken-and-egg problem — you can’t interpret the Bible
until you define the Gospel, but you can’t do that until you define your
interpretation method. It’s a circular argument.</p>
<p>Hey, why don’t we just let the Bible speak for itself? Nah, that’ll
never work — doesn’t sound “scholarly”.</p>
<h2>Rule Zero</h2>
<p>Let’s let the Bible speak for itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Bible is the inspired, inerrant Word of God — if your philosophy
disagrees with the Bible the philosophy is wrong, not the Bible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone should agree with that, but many don’t apply it.</p>
<p>Of course, some things (baptism, Calvinism, pre-trib/post-trib) the
church has fought over for centuries (and people think are unclear). But
if you’re replacing what Paul defined as the Gospel, you’ve got problems
because Paul wrote abundantly clearly — so clear I’ve never heard anyone
say Paul wasn’t obvious, only their alternative gospel (social justice,
good works, etc) should be used anyway, an old problem CS Lewis noted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the other hand we do want, and want very much, to make men treat
Christianity as a means; preferably, of course, as a means to their
own advancement, but, failing that, as a means to anything—even to
social justice. The thing to do is get a man at first to value social
justice as a thing which the Enemy demands, and work him on to the
stage at which he values Christianity because it may produce social
justice. … I have found a passage in a Christian writer where he
recommends his own version of Christianity on the ground that “only
such a faith can outlast the death of old cultures and new
civilizations.” You see the little rift? “Believe this, not because it
is true, but for some other reason”. That’s the game. (“The Screwtape Letters” page 119–120)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Deception Creeps In</h2>
<p>In the scholarly-sounding “Christcentric hermeneutic”, how does it stack
up to rule zero? If you recall we’ve discussed this before in <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/01/the-trouble-with-scholarship.html">the trouble with scholarship</a>;
this theory leads this person to conclude the Bible is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not authoritative.</li>
<li>Error-prone and inconsistent.</li>
<li>Unclear.</li>
<li>Insufficient.</li>
<li>Not applicable.</li>
</ol>
<p>Does that conclusion sound good?</p>
<p>Forgetting the Bible exists as the ultimate authority leads to all kinds
of mistakes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">Substitute gospel of social justice</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/06/red-letter-christianity-clueless-about-sin.html">Wrong ideas about sin</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/04/jesus-was-republican-not-democrat.html">Jesus was a Republican</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/01/shifting-sands-of-post-modern-philosophy.html">Denying absolute truth</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Ignoring rule zero (or using <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/10/tactics-rebellion.html">tactics of rebellion</a>) causes these
errors as people desperately try to cram the square peg of their
personal ideology into the round hole of Biblical truth.</p>
<p>If someone tries to sell you an idea which contradicts the Bible, you’ve
got to choose: either the Bible is right, or philosophy — but they
<em>can’t</em> both be right (we’d suggest sticking with the Bible, but many
popular fads blowing through the church happily discard Biblical truth).</p>
<p>Don’t live in <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/09/matrix-guide-christianity.html">The Matrix of Deception</a> — take the
Bible as the inspired inerrant Word of God and leave all the
“scholarship” to those wanting to change Christianity to their own
designer religion.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
