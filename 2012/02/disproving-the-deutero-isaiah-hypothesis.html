  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>We’ve written on the bogus <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2008/12/deutero-isaiah-hypothesis.html">Deutero-Isaiah Hypothesis</a>
before, and noted you shouldn’t waste your time with it. However, some
people don’t like simple and obvious conclusions, judging by a few
comments on the article:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is patently obvious to me that you are no student of the text at all</li>
<li>one of the silliest, most nonsensical arguments I’ve ever read.</li>
<li>apparent that you’ve performed no scholarship at all</li>
<li>I would have appreciated more insight</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the deutero-Isaiah hypothesis idea is totally bogus, frankly I’ve
got better things to do than waste time on something so obviously wrong,
or as I said in a comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If someone said the moon was made of cheese, would you take the time
to “honor the school of moon-cheese with a dignified, scholarly, and
well-reasoned, honest approach”? I doubt it. Or would you briefly cite
examples of how it’s impossible for the moon to be made of cheese
(since we’ve been there and brought back rocks), and let the
moon-cheese “scholars” blabber all they want?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The deutero-Isaiah has <em>less</em> credibility than the moon-cheese idea.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, let’s look at their method, which mainly involves
vocabulary and style analysis.</p>
<h2>Testing Deutero-Isaiah Hypothesis</h2>
<p>We’ll do what “scholars” did — analyze style and vocabulary. The text
used is something <em>known</em> coming from a single author (because I wrote
it), but comes from different times. The first group will be recent
writings, the second older.</p>
<h3>Testing method</h3>
<p>We’ll use a perl script to get some data from each group, and see if
it’s the same. We took some old articles and some newer ones — <em>these
were less than two years apart</em>. If vocabulary/style analysis is valid,
these two samples should be almost identical.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<h3>Style</h3>
<div class='table-wrapper'>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Old</th>
<th>New</th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Sentence Length</td>
<td>15.3</td>
<td>12.8</td>
<td>83%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Word Length</td>
<td>6.2</td>
<td>6.3</td>
<td>1.0%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>Sentence length varies by about 20%, with word length roughly the same.</p>
<h3>Vocabulary</h3>
<p>Comparing words and how frequently they’re used.</p>
<div class='table-wrapper'>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Old</th>
<th>New</th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>the</td>
<td>6.7%</td>
<td>4.9%</td>
<td>73%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>to</td>
<td>2.1%</td>
<td>2.8%</td>
<td>133%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bible</td>
<td>0.03%</td>
<td>0.81%</td>
<td>2700%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>Also, some words were used in one group, but <em>not</em> in the other. Surplus
is used 0.5% in the old material, not at all in new. Post-modern used 27
times in new, not at all in the old.</p>
<p>Similar to style, vocabulary differs 20% or more new compared to old.</p>
<p>Those are facts from analysis, the question is: does a 20% difference
over a short time prove multiple authors? Remember these samples were
less than two years apart — fairly close together.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Wow, there are two of me! A similar method “scholars” use “proves”
multiple authors. I sure wish my other self would pitch in around here —
and that extra paycheck would be handy.</p>
<p>Or could it be their scholarship is 100% bogus, as said previously:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you believe the inspiration of John as he wrote the authorship of
Isaiah is settled (if you don’t believe in the inspiration of the Holy
Spirit and the inerrancy of the Bible you’ve frankly got much bigger
issues than the authorship of Isaiah).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vocabulary and style can change over time and with subject matter.
Anyone doing any writing notices this when they go back and look at
older writings. It’s pathetic to use it to “prove” multiple authors. Why
use such wrong methodology?</p>
<p>Many times you’ll find the reason surface that Isaiah couldn’t have
foreseen the events he prophesied, thus the only explanation is multiple
authors wrote at different times. By rejecting God, they grasp at straws
to explain away the simplest and obvious conclusion: God exists, and
told Isaiah future events, and Isaiah wrote it down.</p>
<p>Deutero-Isaiah Hypothesis — wrong on common sense, wrong on theology,
wrong on scholarship, just wrong.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
