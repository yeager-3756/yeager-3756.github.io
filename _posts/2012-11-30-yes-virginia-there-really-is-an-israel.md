It’s trendy to blame Israel for everything. Of course, this runs counter
to Israel as God’s people, so what must be done? Simply say Israel isn’t
really Israel — then you can do to the Jews and Israel whatever you
want, and not run afoul of God’s Word.

Absurd? Sure, but don’t confuse liberals with facts.

<blockquote cite="http://storylineblog.com/2012/11/19/the-painful-truth-about-the-situation-in-israel/">
<p>A small but powerful group of evangelicals still believe when the new testament refers to Israel it’s referring to the newfound country rather than a spiritual nation formed in the collective hearts of all believers.</p>
</blockquote>

Could someone please define what a “a spiritual nation formed in the
collective hearts of all believers” is?

This comes dangerously close to replacement theology,
where the church replaced Israel in God’s plan. It’s heresy stemming
from liberal theology.

It’s stunning to see liberals fail to understand major problems with
liberal theology:

-   **WHO** gets to decide what is “spiritual” and what is “real”?
-   **HOW** will they do that?
-   **WHY** is their idea better than anything else?

Liberals like to ignore parts speaking about Israel. Fine. Where do you
draw the line, and what’s real and what’s not? **Liberals *never* answer
the question**.

For those who travel down the dark path of liberal theology, I always
tell them the teaching regarding adultery was just spiritual and a
cultural idiom, it doesn’t really hold today, so ladies, if your husband
cheats on you, it’s no big deal.

After all, **if we’re going to ignore parts of the Bible, everyone is
free to ignore whatever they want**.

Of course, you’ll find very few agreeing with ignoring adultery
teaching, but liberals *love* to ignore other parts. They miss their
so-called scholarship means nobody believes anything.

**Perhaps not everyone espousing liberal ideas truly understands how
absurd the position is**. Perhaps they’ve simply been deceived by
so-called scholars teaching heretical ideas.

It might be popular for teachers and scholars to promote absurd ideas
like social justice is the gospel
or replacement theology, but when you ask them to show you where it is
in the Bible, they can’t (for the simple reason it’s not there).

They’ll be accountable for such wildly absurd ideas on par with the moon
is made of cheese — ideas so absurd they’re laughable.
