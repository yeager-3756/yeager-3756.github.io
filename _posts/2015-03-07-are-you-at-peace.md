summary: You know what? People don't really change much. The same problem the disciples faced thousands of years ago is the exact same problem we frequently encounter — and we react the same way they did. Isn't it time to learn the lesson and be at peace.

Riots. Government corruption. Political instability. Massive government
debt. Wars. Rumors of wars. End times.

Much to be uneasy about, for sure.

Yet should we be? What happened to the peace that passes understanding?

Someone approached me this week wondering if a certain political figure
might be the anti-Christ.

I have no idea, yet the search consumes many people.

The real problem isn’t who the anti-Christ turns out to be (it’s not
Bill Gates, Kissinger, or Barney the Purple Dinosaur) — the church will
be gone before the guy is revealed.

No, it’s the anticipation, it’s worrying about how bad life on planet
earth is going to get. If you read the news at all, it’s going to get a
lot worse, that’s for sure.

Studying Bible prophecy, we know the end point “B.” And we know we’re at
“A” now.

However, knowing how we get from “A” to “B” we *don’t* know. We like to
infer a direction, but when it doesn’t work out that way, we panic.

The disciples were caught in exactly that problem more than once.

When Jesus said “let’s go to the other side of the lake” they added a
bit to what He said. Jesus said “let’s go to the other side,” while they
heard “let’s *cruise* to the other side.”

Thus, when events didn’t exactly work out the way they thought, they
encountered quite a bit of stress. Their peace departed.

So bad was their perceived predicament, they woke Jesus up screaming
Master, we’re dying out here! Don’t you care?

Jesus quieted the storm, and rebuked them for their lack of faith. What
faith?

Not faith in who He was — by waking Him up they *knew* who He was.

No, the faith they lacked was simply believing what He said. He said
we’re going to the other side, without providing details of the trip.

We suffer the same problem. We know end times. We know prophecy. We know
where we’re at now.

But *how* we get from “A” to “B” hasn’t been revealed to us, and just
like the disciples on the boat that day, we scream and fuss, Lord, don’t
you CARE?

Had they remained focused on His words, instead of worrying about how,
they would have remained at peace.

The problem with attempting to identify the anti-Christ isn’t the
impossibility of doing it. Rather, it’s simply a time-waster.

Psalm 90 asks the Lord to teach us to number our days. You may have a
few, or many — you don’t know.

It’s not the *quantity* you should be worried about, it’s the *quality*.

One enemy tactic hasn’t changed much, it involves getting you distracted
from what’s *really* important, and wasting away your hours.

And looking to figure out who the anti-Christ just about tops the list
of time-wasters (well, that and Facebook. I haven’t heard of anyone on
their deathbed list their regrets with one of them being “Gee, I wish I
had Facebooked more”)

Stop horsing around,
spend your time on the important stuff, get your Bible study library
going, and use it while you still can openly.

The more you do that, and the less time spent on worthless pursuits, the
more at peace you’ll become.

Facebook will still be there, I promise.
