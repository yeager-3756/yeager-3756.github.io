Remember James Carville’s famous slogan for the Clinton campaign—“it’s
the economy, stupid”? It was meant to remind staffers to always stay on
message, and the message was the economy. With that single issue,
Clinton won the election.

Today it’s massive Federal debt, and the yearly deficit topping a
Trillion dollars. The bigger problem? The official numbers don’t tell
the real story:

<blockquote cite="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/trillion_in_debt_ZIrWsnLp5l9MAQGe8YTG8J" title="Does anyone know what the US owes?">
<p>While the official number — $13.4 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office — is frightening enough, some analysts say the actual figure is much, much higher. Like a shopaholic who hides their credit card bills, the government pretends certain obligations and expenditures don’t exist. Uncle Sam really owes closer to $60 trillion, or more, and the country is close to&nbsp;bankruptcy.</p>
<p>“<b>The government is lying about the amount of debt</b>,” says Laurence Kotlikoff, an economist at Boston University and co-author of “The Coming Generational Storm: What You Need to Know about America’s Economic Future.” “<b>It is engaging in Enron accounting</b>.”</p>
</blockquote>

The issue *finally* gets some traction as people slowly begin to
comprehend the massive amount of debt the Federal government obligated
their children to pay—and continues to ring up Trillions more in
stimulus, new entitlements, and pork spending.

To put it in perspective, the current administration touts their deficit
reduction plans, but it could take a decade before the yearly deficit
gets back to President Bush levels! Of course, President Bush wasn’t
known for spending frugally, running up large amounts of wasteful
spending himself; instead of acting responsibly, the current
administration doubles down on spending, taking irresponsibility to
stunning new heights.

Worse, the official reports don’t provide a complete picture. Remember
the “Federal surplus” of a few years ago? No such surplus ever existed,
a fact easily (but tediously) verifiable from US Treasury reports.

Your mission (should you decide to accept it—and you should)
is two-fold:

1.  *Learn* the deceptions, and understand the truth.
2.  *Share* the truth with others. Many won’t want accept the truth, but
    keep trying. Provide them with facts and encourage truth-deniers to
    verify it for themselves.

Interested in the truth but don’t want to take days to do the research
yourself? We’ve done the boring homework for you — just read our article
[Myth of the Surplus]({% post_url 2010-06-01-truth-lie-myth-surplus %})
for complete details, containing links to all the government reports and
analysis of what they’re not telling you (our article even has a PDF
version nicely formatted with all the charts and graphs. See the
previous link). *We do the work so you don’t have to*.

Then move on to another area where government reporting has been… ummm …
less than accurate (actually, they admit they made it up). Interested?

It may be a cliche, but it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out
reckless spending is unsustainable and a recipe for disaster. Yet is it
incompetence or actually the desired outcome? Find out about the
[Cloward and Piven Strategy]({% post_url 2010-07-03-cloward-piven-strategy %});
the audacity of deception will take your breath away.

The government reports on the deficit and debt are scary enough; the
truth is much worse, and Washington doesn’t seem to care as they spend
our children’s money, and their children’s, and theirs…

You *must* accept the mission (did Jim Phelps of Mission Impossible ever
refuse?), quite literally the future of the Republic is at risk. What
will you leave your children? If you don’t have kids, remember Paul
reminds us it is *required* of stewards that they be faithful — you’re a
steward of the Republic, and your country needs you — you *can* make
a difference.

Will you answer the call?
