<p>… I do not know of ANY who think they [atheists] are “just as good” as Christians. That, quite honestly, is an insult to me as an Atheist. Not only do I believe that those who have evolved beyond religion, stand on a higher moral ground, but that most Atheists have a much better grasp on reality, are more open minded, more compassionate, and just simply have more common sense than any Christians that I have met.</p>

Atheists “stand on a higher moral ground”? They don’t have *any*
[reference for morality]({% post_url 2009-12-03-problem-morality-where-does-it-come %}),
as even the atheist prophet Dawkins admits (Dawkins can’t even say
Hitler wasn’t wrong in what he did). That doesn’t mean they can’t *be*
moral people, only that they obtain their moral values somewhere else —
the atheist worldview has *no* method for absolute morality — atheism by
itself is without morality.

How about atheists “simply have more common sense than any christians”?
Atheism is by definition illogical and absurd. If you want to call that
“common sense” you can, but it makes you look silly to everyone else who
understands atheism is by definition illogical. Perhaps that’s why
the “New Atheists” frequently use [Dialectic thought]({% post_url 2009-06-06-didactic-dialectic-thought %})
to use two different definitions for atheism. In private, they use the
dictionary [definition of atheism]({% post_url 2010-01-16-atheism-definition %}) (“There is no God”), while in public they revert to a more agnostic definition — lack
of *reason* to believe in God, but not denying His existence.

Thus, in public they attempt to avoid the logical absurdity of atheism,
while in private stating as an unproven fact no God exists. A classic
case of Orwellian
[doublethink]({% post_url 2009-06-27-what-doublethink %})
— “The power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one’s mind
simultaneously, and accepting both of them.”

What about open minded? Are atheists open minded? Not at all. They’ve
[eliminated any discussion of God]({% post_url 2010-01-19-atheism-freethinkers %}) from their thoughts,
and the “New Atheists” are actually quite militant in their God-denying.
Open-minded? We think not.

Compassionate? That’s difficult to measure, but where are the atheist
hospitals? Atheist charities? Atheist organizations helping the homeless
and disaster victims? For the compassion measure, we’ll just say he
doesn’t have any evidence in *support* of his position, although any
measure would be difficult.

The fact they actually believe rants like this is sad, but it
demonstrates the logical absurdity of their position. You’re quite free
to be a God-denier if you wish, but calling it open-minded and common
sense is laughable.
