From advertising to politics to everyday conversation, many people lack
the ability to spot logical errors. This week we’ll cover one of the
more common mistakes, the *argument from authority*.

It’s rather simple, and works like this:

1.  Person “X” is an expert in “Y”
2.  Person “X” says “Z”
3.  Therefore, “Z” must be true since “X” is an expert.

Of course, this is absurd, as it should be the argument, not the person
presenting it, which convinces you. Where the argument comes from
remains irrelevant, the only question should be **is it true**.

So-called **“experts” gave us Piltdown man, a belief the world was flat,
man-caused global warming, and more**. Many of the justifications came
down to simply “the experts say so, thus it must be true”, and those
turned out later to be incorrect.

Perhaps the best known of these are the Dr. Pepper commercials spoofing
this logical error. What’s the tag line? “Trust me, I’m a doctor” (if
you recall the Camel cigarette ads from looooong ago, you remember “What
cigarette do you smoke, Doctor?… more doctors smoke Camels, than any
other cigarette).

For this reason, **Christians should always check out what their pastor
or “Bible expert” proclaims**. Don’t take someone’s word for it, do your
own homework and check things for yourself, as the Bible encourages you
to do. If everyone did their own homework, cults would have fewer
members and the church would be stronger to combat heresy abounding
today (for example spotting the counterfeit Gospel
or in the political realm, the surplus myth,
both survive because people either refuse to do their own research, or
fall victim to the argument from authority.

Don’t fall for the argument from authority as it’s quite common. A
corollary is the *genetic fallacy* where a person rejects an argument
simply because they don’t like where it came from. **The only question
must be is it true?**

Buzzword: also known by the Latin “argumentum ad potentiam”, meaning
argument from power.
