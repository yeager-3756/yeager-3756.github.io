summary: Didactic versus dialectic isn't an abstract debate. It affects you in everyday conversation. Ever wonder why some people won't hold to normal definitions? They're likely recently educated in government schools, and haven't been taught how to think clearly and logically.

We’ve discussed in the past pseudo-scholarship — those with
Ph’d’s and other titles claiming to be knowledgeable, yet
making basic errors in deduction, reason and logic. Many of
those “scholars” make absurd errors, all while sounding
scholarly. One reason for those errors stems from didactic
versus dialectic thought. Stay with us for a bit as we discuss
some terms, but you’ll quickly see how these conflicting ideas
cause considerable problems for the church, as well as the
world at large.

OK, what’s with the $2 words? It’s a vital issue to understand
if you want to comprehend current events, find trends, and
find out what’s *really* going on. Two different methods of
drawing conclusions exist, and while most people believe
analyzing facts to arrive at a conclusion remains the proper
course, those might be surprised upon discovering a completely
different method frequently appears — one ignoring facts as
it needs to.

-   Didactic analysis involves facts and deduction. It’s what most
    people understand to be logic.
-   Dialectic analysis involves consensus and discussion to arrive
    at a conclusion.

If you’re older than 30 or so, you’ve grown up with didactic
thought — analyzing a set of facts to draw a conclusion.
Different people may disagree on the conclusions or analysis,
but facts are facts, and definitions don’t change.

But if you’ve been recently educated (you’re younger than 30
or so), you’re likely trained in dialectic thinking — using
discussion and group-think (even if it’s a small group) to
arrive at conclusions. Facts may or may not be used, and
definitions and concepts shift as required to fit the conclusion.

For example, we’ve discovered people equating the definite
article “the” with the indefinite article “a”. When pointed
out the difference between definite and indefinite articles,
the claim comes they’re equivalent and interchangeable —
classic dialectic thought process as definitions change and
shift as needed (for the record, “the” means singular [specific
item], while “a” implies one of perhaps many. If they’re
equivalent, why call them two different things?). For the
dialectic process, definitions don’t matter, as they shift
as needed.

A similar occurrence happens with atheists — by definition,
atheism claims there is no god. But of course, that makes no
sense as the only way you can claim there is no god is if you
have all knowledge, thus atheism becomes trapped by absurdity.

But we’re seeing many people calling themselves atheists
actually use the term in an agnostic way — agnostics don’t
have a *reason* to believe in god, or say we can’t know, or no
evidence exists, while the atheist makes the bold assertion no
god exists. Again, dialectic thinking rescues the illogical
position of the atheist, who subtly shifts definitions to suit
their purposes. After all, the dialectic atheist says, if other
atheists misuse the term that way (discussion and what the group
thinks), it must be acceptable.

Consulting grammar and the root of the words proves them wrong:

-   a-theism — without god (theism)
-   a-gnostic — without knowledge (gnosis)

The atheist states there is no god, while the agnostic doesn’t
have a reason to believe, as they see no evidence for god.
Again, if atheism equates to agnosticism, why do two words
exist with different roots? Only dialectic thought can equate
the two and rescue the atheist from the absurdity of his position.

Didactic methods appear in science — math, physics, computer
science, chemistry and so on, while dialectic methods appear
in philosophy, psychology, history, literature and similar
areas — if you’ve read Orwell’s “Animal Farm” you’ve seen the
dialectic method in action.

Young people (about 30 years old and younger, or those spending
extensive time in education, especially in English, history,
philosophy, psychology, or similar) have been trained in the
dialectic thought process — building consensus, agreement,
ignoring facts when needed, shifting definitions, and so on.
*Very* few individuals recently educated understand how to draw
conclusions from a set of facts the way their previous
generation did.

Instead, it’s group-think, value relativism, and shifting terms
as needed as dialectic thought becomes more common, and
absolutes are abandoned.

Of course, dialectic thought equally infects the church, as
Christian terms such as Jesus, resurrection, hell, and even
satan change in dialectic tactics to change Christianity from
standing for something, to something which falls for anything.
How many different winds of doctrine blow through the Church?
From the Toronto Blessing, to the Emergent Church, the purpose
driven life, and more — they all have one thing in common —
using dialectic thought to change meaning, either to better meld
with the world and it’s views, or to avoid those pesky areas of
the Bible which remain stubbornly clear.

It might surprise you to learn many pastors don’t hold to the
virgin birth, reality of hell, existence of satan, inerrancy of
the Bible, the rapture, literal return of Jesus, and many other
basic Christian doctrines. They may *sound* orthodox — even
using the same terms — but they don’t mean the same as they
use dialectic thought.

The question for the church is simple — when did God’s Word
become insufficient? When did it become irrelevant? And why
abandon the absolute of God’s Word for the shifting sand of
man’s wisdom?
