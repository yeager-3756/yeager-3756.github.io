I’ve said to understand your Bible you must understand Physics. Yes, you
don’t necessarily *have* to, but frequently some basic understanding of
Physics clears up controversy or provides insight. Don’t worry, we won’t
be delving too much into areas you haven’t heard of as we’re interested
in application of the Bible, not science for science sake.

In part II of this series, we’ll consider a passage in Zechariah, and
how Quantum Tunneling provides insight into the Biblical text.

> Who art thou, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel thou shalt become a
> plain; and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings,
> crying, Grace, grace unto it. (Zechariah 4:7)

Quantum Tunneling
-----------------

[Quantum tunneling](http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/glossary/quantum_tunneling.html)
is a principle in Physics where an entity lacking sufficient energy to
cross a barrier somehow finds itself on the other side.

Think of it as if you were trying to roll a bowling ball over Mount
Everest. You certainly could not roll the ball hard enough to get it up
and over, yet your friend on the other side of the mountain somehow
finds the ball on the other side. It “tunneled” through as it lacked the
ability to roll over.

Change the previous paragraph with some technical jargon and you’ve got
Quantum Tunneling.

So What?
--------

Look at the passage in Zechariah again — the mountain becomes a plain
before the Lord. What is that a description of? Zerubbabel sees a
mountain before him as he’s rebuilding the temple. But from the Lord’s
view? No big deal, the mountains Zerubbabel sees are from his resources
and strength; the previous verse reminds Zerubbabel where the power
*really* comes from.

> Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the
> LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my
> spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.

Using our skills and ideas, we see a huge mountain. But when we rely on
the Lord? Nothing but a flat plain.

Do you have mountains in your life — areas you believe you lack the
ability to get over or conquer? Perhaps it’s time to take the word of
the Lord to Zerubbabel and apply it to your life. It’s not by your
education, money, fame or anything else, only by the Lord’s spirit.

It’s perspective. Many times we see huge mountains in our lives, yet to
God they’re nothing but flat plains.
