**Very few people would disagree public education is anything other than
a failure** as it gets worse and worse. A new study *proves* college
fails in the most important idea to teach: learning how to learn, with
logic and critical thinking.

<p>Forty-five percent of students made no significant improvement in their critical thinking, reasoning or writing skills during the first two years of college, according to the study. After four years, 36 percent showed no significant gains in these so-called “higher order” thinking&nbsp;skills.</p>

Group Think Failure
-------------------

How does the modern, trendy “group consensus” process work? Amazingly
poorly, it turns out.

<blockquote cite="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2011/01/18/106949/study-many-college-students-not.html">
<p>The study also showed that students who studied alone made more significant gains in learning than those who studied in&nbsp;groups.</p>
<p>“I’m not surprised at the results,” said Stephen G. Emerson, the president of Haverford College in Pennsylvania. “Our very best students don’t study in groups. They might work in groups in lab projects. But when they study, they study by&nbsp;themselves.”</p>
</blockquote>

**The consensus process transformed students from getting it right to
feeling good about being wrong** — many people have
stunning errors in logic. The
ability to think clearly and logically simply isn’t taught anymore, and
students (and later adults) **lack the ability to analyze a set of facts
to arrive at a conclusion**, instead looking for a group to form
consensus with — even if that group decides 2+2=5.

Learn How To Learn
------------------

*THE* most important concept is **learn how to learn** and **think for
yourself**, avoiding group-think and consensus. Unfortunately, public
education will *not* provide you with this most basic skill — you’ll
need to do it yourself, especially if you’ve been recently educated.

To begin your quest, start with the book “Discerning Truth” by Dr. Jason
Lisle (ISBN 978-0890515945). It’s an easy read and not dry at all if
you’re afraid of a boring logic textbook.
