Bill Maher may hold strange views, but one thing we admire him for—he’ll
state his views straight out, without any attempt to sugar coat it or
show tact (at least he’s *honest* and proudly proclaims his views, in
contrast to others who attempt to hide it. He’s consistent in his
atheist far-left elitist views). Recently on his show atheist S.E. Cupp
appeared, whose latest book titled “Losing Our Religion: The Liberal
Media’s Attack on Christianity” created some interesting discussion, and
displayed the paradox of atheism.

That show generated the following response from one of S.E.’s
fellow atheists.

> 1.  Religious people are deluded, regardless of whether they’re good
>     or bad people.
> 2.  Religion is often bad in and of itself, even without people doing
>     bad things in the name of it.
> 3.  Teaching ignorance (via Creationism) is a form of child abuse,
>     whether it’s done with the best of intentions or not.

Atheists generally hold themselves up as defenders of tolerance, masters
of free-thinking and logic, free from all bias and dogma they associate
with religion. Yet notice the assumptions from someone likely
considering themselves a
[free-thinker]({% post_url 2010-01-19-atheism-freethinkers %}):

1.  God doesn’t exist (“Religious people are deluded”), in other words
    atheism is a fact by his personal fiat. Of course [atheism is illogical]({% post_url 2010-01-16-atheism-definition %}), so this point
    by itself displays a lack of logic and critical thinking.
2.  Religion is bad in and of itself, *apart from any actions*. That
    displays a clear bias and a lack of free-thinking as ideas are
    already assumed good or bad apart from any proof or logical
    analysis. Who gets to make these fiat rules? What makes this person
    the arbiter of things good and bad? As atheism has no basis for morality
    according to Dawkins, those kind of absolute moral statements are
    quite bizarre; without any absolute standards (as Dawkins noted),
    *nothing* can be stated as good or bad.
3.  Evolution is true by fiat *without any scientific base behind it*.
    We’ve written [much on evolution](/categories.html#evolution), and consider
    [evolution’s case closed]({% post_url 2010-05-06-evolution-beginnings-universe-case-closed %})
    as it has no experimental scientific evidence for its foundations.
    It’s taken on faith, without proof. You’re free to believe in the
    philosophy of evolution and the beginnings of the universe if you
    wish (“first there was nothing, and then it exploded; from the goo
    to the zoo to you”), but it’s not science.

Another “tolerant free thinking atheist”—the very definition of oxymoron
(self-contradicting phrase).

People are free to believe whatever they want, but it’s rather bizarre
(and illogical) to hold yourself up as a beacon of free-thinking,
tolerance, and logic, while promoting such absurdly illogical views that
don’t stand the smallest scrutiny (atheism), displaying intolerance
toward others (religion is bad in and of itself) and attempting to
proclaim absolute morality while simultaneously denying it exists, and
even attempting to silence and censor opposing views you don’t believe
in (teaching alternative theories is child abuse).

That’s not very tolerant, free thinking, or logical—it’s too bad
atheists miss the irony of their illogical position.
