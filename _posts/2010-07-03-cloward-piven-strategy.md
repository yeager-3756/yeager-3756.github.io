Yes, the idea *is* as crazy as it sounds. The Cloward & Piven strategy
seeks to *deliberately* crash a country in order to replace it with some
alternate (in their minds) utopia.

How does this idea relate to current political situations? As the
current [national debt](http://www.usdebtclock.org/) races past 13
Trillion dollars (and as high as 55 Trillion or more when you add
entitlements like Social Security and Medicare), why does Congress and
the Administration continue to spend wildly?

Are they playing out the Cloward-Piven strategy before our eyes? It’s
hard to believe such people exist, but denying it makes the problem much
more dangerous. Cloward and Piven are not fringe elements with no
support, they were [invited to the signing](http://www.examiner.com/x-25466-DC-Independent-Examiner~y2009m11d22-ClowardPiven-Government)
of a bill under President Clinton in 1993.

As bizarre as the strategy sounds, look at current events through the
filter and see if it possibly fits. What if it’s not simply incompetence
or mistakes fueling wild unsustainable spending and other failures, but
the desired outcome?

Washington news fails to tell the whole story and hides the true
