When your 3AM call finally arrives (and one day it will), will you be
prepared to handle it? We frequently discuss various bad ideas blowing
through the church, but what if you’re suddenly all alone — will you be
able to determine heresy from reality?

It comes down to one word: motivation.

Lou Holtz is one of my favorite commentators; his special segments on
ESPN are priceless. If you’ve caught him on a political program
discussing current events, you can only come to one conclusion: Lou
Holtz for President.

Lou has a masterful way of getting the most out of his players. Let’s
apply Lou’s method to Christianity.

> -   **Ability** is what you’re capable of doing.
> -   **Motivation** determines what you do.
> -   **Attitude** determines how well you do it. (Lou Holtz)

Ability
-------

In sports, some have more ability than others. In the church, *everyone*
has the basic ability to perform their own studies. Can you read? Do you
have common sense? Then you’re qualified.

Sure, learning Greek, logic, textual analysis, and critical thinking at
times will help, but make no excuses — *everyone* in the church has the
ability to do their own homework.

God didn’t lock His truths away so only a learned few could understand.

99.5% of people in church have the basic skills needed. No excuses.
You’re *capable* of in-depth study, so Lou moves on to the next step:
motivation.

Motivation
----------

Motivation determines what you do. You could have the ability to run a
sub-10 second 100 meter dash, but if you don’t put down the bon-bons and
get off the couch, you’ll never accomplish what your ability allows you
to do.

That’s a big problem in the church: slothfulness.

It’s easy to say, hey, the pastor will be around to answer questions and
figure out the tough stuff.

That’s not a sure thing. What will you do when nobody is around? It’s a
sad commentary on our society watching everyone look for a bailout — as
long as someone else pays, I want free stuff!

The same attitude infests the church. It’s time to get off the couch,
and get in the game.

Attitude
--------

Attitude is tough. Ability and motivation only take you so far. What if
a soldier has a bad attitude? Will their training be effective?

When the bad-attitude soldier enters combat, they’ll be easy prey for
the enemy.

Of course, the same idea applies to *you*. Once motivated to get
involved, it’s time to have the correct attitude — never quit, never
give in, never surrender.

Dare to get in the game. If you need help, ask questions.

What’s holding you back … right now? More importantly, what can we do to
help you through it? Email, comment, ask.

> How you respond to the challenge in the second half will determine
> what you become after the game, whether you are a winner or a loser.
> (Lou Holtz)

… because it’s 2:59AM.

> It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the
> strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them
> better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,
> whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives
> valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is
> no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive
> to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who
> spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the
> triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at
> least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be
> with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.
> (Theodore Roosevelt "The Man in The Arena")
