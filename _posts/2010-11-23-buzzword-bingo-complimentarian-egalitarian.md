Christians seem to fight over anything and everything. Chuck Missler
asks why Christians organize their firing squads in circles. Today’s
buzzword bingo involves Complimentarian and Egalitarian, or the proper role of men and
women. We’ve discussed it before, but it’s surprising how many people reject
what the Bible states, creating their own religion.

The Problem of Gender Roles
---------------------------

Briefly, the modern feminist idea of egalitarian means men and women
function identically in the church (and elsewhere) — men and women are
literally interchangeable parts. The Complimentarian position hearkens
back to Genesis and Paul, and what they say about roles.

As usual, words get thrown around, but it’s not the words, it’s what is
true, Biblically based. Thus, we’ll dispense with buzzwords and try to
arrive at a simple idea: what does the Bible say?

### The Word Feminists Ban

What does the Bible say regarding men and women? As soon as the word
“submission” appears, many express a knee-jerk reaction — why are women
second-class? Why are they inferior? This leads to domestic violence!
Abuse! Poor self-esteem. And on and on…

But where in the Bible does it say anything even *close* to men are
better than women, husbands should be dictators, women are second-class,
and so on? (Hint: it doesn’t). By expressing those ideas, those people
fight against something the Bible never states; those discussions are
off-topic (commonly known as a red-herring, whether the person promoting
them knows it or not), and prevent us from finding out truth.

Don’t come to the Bible with preconceived ideas and try to make it fit,
rather let the Bible mold your ideas.

Bible Based Views of Men and Women
----------------------------------

In the roles of men and women, perhaps some confusion arises because
people aren’t familiar with military order. Military order? You bet. You
see, if you don’t understand you’re already in battle — and behind enemy
lines — you’ve got much bigger problems (people who don’t understand
Ephesians six we call casualties).

The Christian is a soldier, and as Paul said “You therefore must endure
hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.” In other words, it’s not
what *I* want, it’s following after Christ. As a soldier, many times the
private doesn’t understand the greater strategy, but must trust and
follow the chain of command.

Think of marriage as a military unit (you’re already in battle behind
enemy lines). To use an analogy, the Marines organize by the “rule of
threes”, with the lowest unit being a Fire Team:

-   Team leader (M4/M16)
-   Rifleman (M4/M16)
-   Grenadier (M4/M16 with M203)
-   Machine gunner (M249)

Does the guy with the machine gun complain and say “HEY! why is the
grenadier better than me?” Nope (not if they want to function as a
unit). Each member has specific uses for various tactical situations,
while the team needs a leader, just as the marriage needs a leader. Why
is it organized that way? Because God said so. Period. That should end
the debate.

For some reason, it doesn’t (or as Chuck Missler says “never
underestimate a person’s ability to rationalize”).

The team has a leader, but the Fire Team itself forms with others to
make a squad, with a squad leader. Squads form platoons, and so on. Each
unit has a leader, and each lower unit submits to the chain of command.

CRAP! There’s that #@$! word again — submission. Why are some of the
team treated so poorly? This leads to abuse! Why are some of the team
superior over others? Why is the squad leader superior to the team
leader? All these issues stem from one misunderstanding:

LEADERSHIP DOES NOT IMPLY SUPERIORITY OR INFERIORITY.

Leadership and Order
--------------------

Like Corinth the modern church allows ideas from popular culture to
creep in — like feminism, [social justice]({% post_url 2010-08-02-social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel %}),
secular methods to promote church growth, the latest “best-seller”, and
other ideas coming from godless culture, not the Bible. Ultimately all
these water down the Gospel, and distract many (as Paul told Timothy)
who no longer want sound doctrine, but according to their own desires,
find teachers who tell them what they want to hear.

Most importantly, people confuse *submit* with *obey*.

-   submit — To voluntarily defer to another’s judgment and decision.
-   obey — To comply with orders or follow commands.

That should end the debate, but it doesn’t.

### Military and Illegal Orders

Even in the military, you are *not* to follow illegal orders (such as
spare no one). You can’t justify hideous actions by proclaiming “I was
just following orders”. Leadership never demands blind following. God
gave you a brain — use it.

Nobody has to follow the Bible if they don’t want — you’re always free
to live as you want. Of course, the epitome of hubris comes as some
proclaim God didn’t really mean what He said, when it’s in black and
white in front of their eyes.

Of course, that does *not* imply a woman should take abuse. That should
go without saying, but anytime this subject comes up someone complains
about it, so let’s be clear.

That should end the debate, but it doesn’t.

A Food Example
--------------

Let’s shift gears, and consider an illustration. Is an apple superior to
a carrot? Of course not, they have different uses in the body, and the
differences make both fruit *and* vegetables required if you’re going to
be healthy. If you have scurvy (from lack of vitamin C), you’ll require
an orange much more than a carrot.

Why oh why is the carrot not used? You can’t force a carrot to perform
an apple’s job; they’re not the same, and can’t perform in the same way.
Why can’t the carrot be considered equal to the apple? Because carrots
and apples are *not* equal, **but that doesn’t mean one is superior**.
If you want to have a healthy body, you’d better have *both*, as each
perform distinct roles. Different strengths, different roles. That’s it.
Not superiority, just different.

That should end the debate, but it doesn’t.

Leadership isn’t Dictatorship
-----------------------------

The idea of military chain-of-command continues. Families group together
in home fellowships, those fellowships group into a church, the churches
(usually) form a denomination, and those groups form the body of Christ,
with Him at the head.

Foolish is the leader who ignores the suggestions of his team, abuses
them, or performs any of the other common objections raised. As
Lieutenant Colonel Allen West said “If it’s about the lives of my men
and their safety, I’d go through Hell with a gasoline can”. A leader
doesn’t shout “go forward”, he proclaims “follow me”. No matter who you
are, people follow a leader with their interests at heart, the mission
to protect them, and who sets an example to follow.

Leadership isn’t about superiority, it’s about … well … *leadership*.

No bozo messing up leadership invalidates the principle, however. You
don’t see the Marines abandon the structure because a psycho messes it
up. Nope, they handle the problem, correct it, and move on. Everyone is
flawed, everyone makes mistakes.

As the supreme example, Jesus didn’t come down and issue a bunch of
rules, He said follow me. That’s leadership. As Paul spoke “Husbands,
love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself
for it”. In other words, man up, and follow the example and words of
Paul, Jesus, and the practical example of Allen West.

Easy to say, hard to do.

That should end the debate, but it doesn’t.

Conclusion
----------

None of this means women can’t be involved in the church (another red
herring), should take abuse (by their husband or anyone else for that
matter), or any of the other distracting arguments frequently brought
up. Paul spoke of women *when* they pray or prophesy, so those
distractions aren’t correct; Paul *did* lay out some principles for
church leadership (1 Timothy 2:12, which most scholars agree prohibits
women serving as pastors), as well as husbands and wives (1
Corinthians, Ephesians).

Paul’s clear teaching should end the debate, but it doesn’t.

### Your Free Will

You’re free to ignore any or all of God’s Word as you wish, but let’s
not pretend Paul never taught on these matters, or take the
pick-and-choose idea of claiming some of God’s Word doesn’t apply. Don’t
claim Biblical teaching promotes women as second-class or inferior.
Don’t claim the Bible teaches women should tolerate abuse. Don’t bring
up red herring issues which fail to deal with the main subject.

For those rejecting what Paul taught, they’re throwing out parts of the
Bible. They might be comfortable with that, but I’m sure not. Who wants
to stand before God and tell Him his Word was wrong?

It’s leadership and military organization, not superiority. Let’s not
confuse those two.

That should end the debate, but it probably won’t.
