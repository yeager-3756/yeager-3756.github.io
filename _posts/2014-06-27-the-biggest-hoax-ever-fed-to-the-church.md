*Dad, what’s a “Power Ballad”?*

Well, son, you’re getting older, and we’ve never really talked about it,
but it’s time you learned about *hair bands of the 1980’s*.

Great White. Ratt. Poison. Cinderella. Whitesnake.

I’ve listened to most of them, and many 80’s bands shared a search for
meaning for life, or as Bret Michaels said *something to believe in*. No
matter how much fame, fortune, and general excesses they indulged in,
nothing satisfied.

It shouldn’t be a surprise many reports exist of those guys becoming
Christians.

History repeats itself. After the 90’s and 00’s, the same attitude of
hopelessness, despair, and searching for something has returned.

I receive email from people who think God hates them, they’ve lost their
salvation and they want to die. Despair. Desperation. Hopelessness.

We’ve become cynical about God, from the TV preachers preaching a genie
God you get wishes from, to the depressed post-modern progressive “Christians”
who deny absolutes exist; we can’t even know *if* God exists, let alone
if He really cares.

With such stunning misinformation and deception, should it surprise us
many people live searching for something to believe in? And even when
they *do* find God, it’s such an incorrect and false image it provides
no comfort either.

Let me be blunt — post-modern “Christianity” (and it’s twin liberal theology
might be the biggest hoax and deception ever to infest (and that’s the
correct word) the church.

It’s laughably absurd — post-modernism proclaims no absolutes exist,
*except the absolute no absolutes exist*. It’s pure mumbo-jumbo intended
to deceive and confuse.

Tell post-modernists you want to take their car, drain their bank
account, and kick their puppy. That’s all acceptable in post-modernism,
after all, what’s truth for me may not be truth for you — absolutes such
as right and wrong don’t exist.

Naturally, they’ll quickly admit *some* absolutes exist (like stealing
and kicking puppies is wrong), all while clinging to post-modernism’s
absurd denying the existence of absolutes.

Yep, it’s as laughable (and pathetic) as it sounds.

It violates the law of non-contradiction,
which simply means something can’t be both true and false *at the same
time*.

Post-modernism and liberal theology proclaim at the same time absolutes
do (and yet do not) exist. It’s the logical equivalent of gibberish.

Yet post-modernism no longer remains only a bizarre philosophical error
— it affects real people, and has real consequences. We must meet the
error where it stands and boldly proclaim its absurdity. Once people
truly understand how laughable post-modernism and liberal theology are,
they’ll naturally reject it.

Post-modernism really is that insanely stupid — they only way to get
people to swallow it comes from hand-waving — trying to hide doggy
poo-poo in mountains of paper, also known as “scholarship.”

Once you strip away all the stacks of nonsense, you discover a pile of
doggy poo, and instantly realize the complete stench of the idea.

Liberal theology proclaims we can pick-and-choose which parts are—and
are not—God’s Word. Don’t like what Paul says? Simple, just say it only
applied then, or Paul didn’t really write it, or it was cultural for
that time only.

Basically, the strategy becomes *anything* BUT God’s Word.

Under that mumbo-jumbo, is it any wonder people are confused about God,
and if He even exists? People need something to believe in, and the
deception of post-modern liberal theology delivers nothing but
emptiness.

God is a rock, not philosophical mumbo-jumbo.

Post-modernism and liberal theology represent open rebellion against
God, but lack the guts to admit it. It desires to *appear* religious,
all while saying this part of Bible doesn’t apply today, and you can
ignore that part, and so on.

We need to stand up for the truth of God — He’s not a genie granting
wishes. Life is hard — in other words, you may not get a Lexus, an ice
cream, or a pony.

Because there really are no atheists in hair bands, and absolutes (and
God) really do exist — God won’t quit on you. Sin is real. Hell is real.

And that’s something to believe in. Absolutely.
