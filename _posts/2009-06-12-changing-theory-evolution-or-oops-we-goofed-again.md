Remember those charts from school detailing how birds evolved from
dinosaurs? It turns out [those are false](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090609092055.htm):

<blockquote>
<p>ScienceDaily (June 9, 2009) — Researchers at Oregon State University have made a fundamental new discovery about how birds breathe and have a lung capacity that allows for flight — and the finding means it’s unlikely that birds descended from any known theropod&nbsp;dinosaurs.</p>
<p>The conclusions add to other evolving evidence that may finally force many paleontologists to reconsider their long-held belief that modern birds are the direct descendants of ancient, meat-eating dinosaurs, OSU researchers&nbsp;say.</p>

Those (in)famous charts turn out to be bogus — if *any* proof existed
for them they wouldn’t find out later it’s completely wrong. Evolution
lacks proof, and the textbooks presenting those charts of fish growing
legs, birds from dinosaurs, and horses evolving are only hypothesis
(guesses) — they don’t have proof.

This new discovery demonstrates a *major* oops in evolution — an error
preached for decades as gospel truth. Why was it ever presented as
anything more than a guess? Where is the *scientific* (repeatable,
experimental data) evidence for evolutionary principles?

1.  Matter comes from nothing.
2.  Non-living material can spontaneously become alive.
3.  Species can change from one to another.
4.  Explosions produce order.

If *any* of those turn out to be false, evolution falls to the scrap
heap. Yet they’ve all been assumed, simply because they’re *required*
for evolution to occur. But that’s not science.

We’re posed this question for years, and have yet to see scientific data
for them — remember the scientific method involves repeatable,
experimental data. If you don’t have that, it’s not science — **by
definition**.
