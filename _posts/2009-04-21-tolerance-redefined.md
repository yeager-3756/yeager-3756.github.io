What defines tolerance? Is the following what you have in mind when
you’re told to be “tolerant” of other beliefs?

> a fair, objective, and permissive attitude toward those
>  whose opinions, practices, race, religion, nationality, etc.,
>  differ from one’s own; freedom from bigotry. 2. a fair,
>  objective, and permissive attitude toward opinions and
>  practices that differ from one’s own. 3. interest in and
>  concern for ideas, opinions, practices, etc., foreign to
>  one’s own; a liberal, undogmatic viewpoint.

Perhaps not many watch the Miss USA pageant, but lately scandal after
scandal envelops Mr. Trump’s events. This year provides no exception as
intolerance rears it’s ugly head … at a beauty pageant. Miss California
Carrie Prejean (a student at San Diego Christian College) provided this
response during the Q&A session regarding same-sex marriage:

> “We live in a land where you can choose same-sex marriage or
>  opposite. And you know what, I think in my country, in my
>  family, I think that I believe that a marriage should be
>  between a man and a woman. No offense to anybody out there,
>  but that’s how I was raised.”

One of the judges reportedly said after the event:

> “She lost it because of that question,” Hilton said Monday.
>  “She was definitely the front-runner before that.” Hilton,
>  who is gay, said he gave Prejean a zero for her answer, and
>  that may have made the difference in the outcome.

We hear “tolerance” thrown about, but after the hate-filled diatribes
launched against her, and one judge admitting she lost because he didn’t
like her answer, where is the tolerance? Why was that question in the
mix anyway? How can so many display hate toward her, while espousing
tolerance at the same time?

Because they’ve redefined tolerance.

Tolerance no longer means you have your views and I’ll have mine, as we
discuss and debate each other, but in the end if we don’t agree that’s
fine, as we’ll both be respectful of the other. That’s what most people
would mean by tolerance (and the dictionary definition).

But that’s not what many mean by tolerance anymore, as the response to
Carrie Prejean obviously demonstrates. The new “tolerance” means
everyone must accept *their* views, and society must change the way
*they* want, or else you’re intolerant. And of course, since they’re
right, anything done to you is acceptable and correct. It’s value
relativism and situational ethics as whether something displays
intolerance or not depends on who said it. That’s how they hold the
contradictory position of justifying their hateful speech, while at the
same time claim they’re showing tolerance.

The intolerance of the tolerant crowd makes as much sense as the value
relativism crowd saying the only absolute is no absolutes exist. In
other words, the *only* supreme rule is there are no rules, and everyone
does what is right in their own eyes. Huh? But that’s the twisted logic
of value relativism and the “tolerant” crowd when attempting to justify
their contradictory actions.

Sound bizarre? Consider the difference Miss California Carrie Prejean
received verses President Obama during the campaign:

> I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in
>  favor of gay marriage (Candidate Obama).
> [ABC News](http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/11/obama-on-mtv-i.html)

Where was the hate-filled rants against candidate Obama? What about
Vice-President Biden as he expressed similar views? “Tolerance” depends
on who says what — on the one hand, a liberal politician becomes elected
President, while a Christian student has her title denied, yet both
expressed similar views. So much for any pretense of consistency —
tolerance depends on who says what and when without any consistency.

Regardless of your views on marriage of any kind, any reasonable person
must admit the bizarre responses (to be polite, as some of them can’t be
repeated in a family-friendly way) display remarkable intolerance of her
views (and even hate directed toward her *personally*). After all, it’s
a beauty pageant and had little to do with politics — at least until the
Miss USA committee knowingly approved questions they knew to be a trap.

Interesting what her sister (who supports same-sex marriage) had to say:

> Prejean also said that her sister, a second lieutenant in the
>  United States Air Force, and a supporter of gay marriage, was
>  not offended by her answer.
>  “She was just in my hotel room and she said, ‘Sis, I’m not
>  offended by anything that you said. We have two different
>  opinions and I love you because of it. I love you because you
>  stood up for what was right …’”

So who displayed tolerance toward a view they disagreed with?

The same tolerant/intolerant mess pops up with religion. True tolerance
means you believe in your god, and I’ll believe in mine — we’ll debate
and discuss, but in the end it’s a personal choice each person makes.
You present your case to me, and I’ll present mine to you, but in the
end we’re free to believe however we wish.

But again, that’s not how tolerance is used. Tolerance means no
absolutes exist, and anyone claiming such displays intolerance, and thus
any actions taken against the “intolerant” person becomes acceptable to
force them to the “correct” view. As such, Christianity, Judaism, and
Islam are all “intolerant” as they all claim exclusivity (of course,
they can’t *all* be right, but that’s a topic for another time). And
instead of rational, reasoned discussion, viscous attacks, hatred, and
true intolerance become directed at various groups, as those groups
don’t fit with the anything-goes New World Order (their term, not mine)
where no absolutes exist (except the rule no absolutes exist … oh, my
head hurts).

Be *vary* careful with how the word “tolerance” appears — many don’t use
the normal definitions the rest of us would. Virtually everyone would
agree tolerance — respecting others beliefs — is a good thing. But as
Miss California Carrie Prejean found out, it’s not the way the
“tolerant” crowd uses tolerance. Be sure you’re defining terms so we all
agree on what tolerance is, and point out to the “tolerant” crowd just
how intolerant they are.

George Orwell was right in “1984” as doublethink becomes the official
language, if off by a few years in his predictions.

> The power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one’s mind
>  simultaneously, and accepting both of them. … To tell

>  any fact that has become inconvenient, and then, when it

>  objective reality and all the while to take account of the
>  reality which one denies all this is indispensably
>  necessary. Even in using the word doublethink it is
>  necessary to exercise doublethink. For by using the word one
