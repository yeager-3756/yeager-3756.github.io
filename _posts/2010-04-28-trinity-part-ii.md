In [part one on the Trinity]({% post_url 2010-04-13-trinity-part-i %}) we
discussed problems arising in the Bible if you deny the Trinity as some
groups do: stating Jesus as a created being, a brother of satan, or
something else non-divine. In this second part, we’ll consider the
*scientific* reasoning behind the trinity from a passage in 1 John.

> θεός (God-theos) ἐστί (is-esti) φῶς (light-phos) (1 John 1:5)

John states plainly God *is* light. If you have any background in
Physics, you immediately think of the [wave-particle duality](http://physics.about.com/od/lightoptics/a/waveparticle.htm) of
light. In brief, light can act as either a particle (like bullets shot
from a machine gun), or a wave (like waves in a pool).

Physicists created the famous [two-slit experiment](http://physics.about.com/od/lightoptics/a/doubleslit.htm)
for light, which clearly demonstrates light acting as a wave — the wave
interference pattern clearly visible. But more interesting, if you tweak
the experiment a bit, you destroy the interference pattern, and get only
the particle aspect.

What’s going on? We won’t dive into the details here, the second page of
the [two-slit experiment](http://physics.about.com/od/lightoptics/a/doubleslit.htm)
article has a good introduction to the phenomena. For our purposes, it’s
sufficient to state light acts as *both* a particle *and* a wave, with
the interesting effect you can’t see both at the same time, no matter
how hard you try.

Light is a two-in-one if you will, a *duality*. John says God is light.
In the Gospels it’s also clear God is a trinity.

Whoops. Houston, we’ve got a problem here. God is light, God is a
trinity, but light is a duality. Tilt.

What to do? This should bother you, for if the Bible is inerrant,
something else must be going on. And of course it is, and it’s the
apostle John himself giving you the solution in his Gospel.

> However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you
> into all truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but
> whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come.
> (John 16:13 NKJV)

The Holy Spirit *never* speaks of Himself, His job is to testify of
Jesus. In other words, while God is a trinity, one of the persons only
appears speaking of the others — i.e. the Holy Spirit testifies
of Jesus.

For those physicists attempting to unlock the secrets of the universe,
they’d best investigate light as a trinity, but one of those natures
only manifests itself as either a wave or particle.
