The first or second most popular article on this site over the last
*decade* remains [Can You Lose Your Salvation?]({% post_url 2008-01-01-can-you-lose-your-salvation %}),
and while I don’t track email trends, the subject certainly gets much
email attention also. One area I *haven’t* written on involves the idea
once you desire to get back from a carnal life *how* the heck are you
supposed to begin?

Will God Take Me Back?
----------------------

Perhaps the first issue people have is will God even accept me? I’ve
heard from lots of people on the losing salvation issue, and even for
those who incorrectly believe it *is* possible, they don’t claim a
person who seeks after God will be rejected by Him (cue the Marv Albert
sound track “reeeeeeeeejected!”).

Thus, it doesn’t really mater if you can or can’t lose your salvation
(even though you can’t), the issue remains if you return to the Lord He
won’t turn you away, as Jesus in John 6:37 said “him that cometh to me I
will in no wise cast out”, so unless Jesus lied (hint: He can’t), you
don’t have to worry about being turned away *if* you desire to return.

In the story of the prodigal son in Luke 15:11–32, notice the father
didn’t turn away the son after he returned from his improper life.

The Journey
-----------

How do you begin? Step one requires finding a church — easier said than
done, I know. We’ll lay out a few requirements for a church (and note
potlucks don’t make the list):

-   Teaches through the *entire* Bible, chapter by chapter, book by
    book, verse by verse.
-   Takes the Bible seriously, rejecting [post-modern philosophy]({% post_url 2011-11-18-post-modern-philosophy-church %}).
-   Actually believes Jesus is God, born of a virgin, died on the cross
    for our sins, rose the third day, and by his completed work we can
    be forgiven.

Surprisingly, some people have [problems understanding the Gospel]({% post_url 2010-08-02-social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel %}),
and if they get that wrong (since Paul clearly defined it), they’ll
likely steer you wrong on many (most?) other issues as well.

You’ve got to find a church taking the Bible seriously, and teaching
through *all* of it.

To get started right now, [listen to Chuck Smith’s messages](http://twft.com/?page=C2000) over the entire Bible. For $25
you can get his [series over the entire Bible on MP3](http://store.calvarychapel.com/cccm_store_/catalog/display.php?psku=828147605076)
(it’s on six DVD’s).

If you want to obtain a basic but thorough understanding of the Bible,
you begin with Chuck Smith. Period. It’s Christianity 101.

Get back in fellowship, because it’s 2:59 AM...
