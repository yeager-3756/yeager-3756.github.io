The Roman breastplate covered the chest and those hard-to-live-without
organs — heart, lungs, etc. Lacking advanced medicine, a blow through
the ancient breastplate usually proved fatal. Obviously, if you wanted a
long career, insuring your breastplate could defeat the enemy’s weapons
was more than a good idea — it was survival itself.

What does Paul mean by righteousness? Many people interpret the
breastplate of righteousness to be the righteousness God imputes to us
through a saving faith in Jesus Christ. But that righteousness is given
to us when we are saved, so that *can’t* be what Paul has in mind.

Return to chapter 1, verse 1, and notice Paul already assumes you are
saved. Thus, since Paul exhorts us to put on this armor, it must be
something you *don’t* have (yet).

While it’s true we have the righteousness of Jesus imputed to us, and
our own righteousness cannot cover us, what Paul really gets at here is
the *practical* righteousness of day to day living.

An example from the book of Daniel should explain.

> It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty
> princes, which should be over the whole kingdom; And over these three
> presidents; of whom Daniel was first: that the princes might give
> accounts unto them, and the king should have no damage. Then this
> Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an
> excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the
> whole realm. Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion
> against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none
> occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there
> any error or fault found in him. Then said these men, We shall not
> find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him
> concerning the law of his God. (Daniel 6:1–5)

After Daniel rose to prominence, other administrators became jealous and
wanted to remove Daniel from his position so they desired to find some
dirt on him.

Imagine modern politics — you hire an investigator to search a person’s
past, and eventually you come to a “youthful indiscretion” you can
exploit to your advantage. That’s exactly what these administrators
attempted.

Only one problem with their plan — Daniel didn’t have any skeletons to
dig up so they conclude the only way to get Daniel is by creating a
conflict between the law of government and the law of God. Daniel would
follow the law of God, and they would have him.

Daniel examples the breastplate of righteousness. He lived his life so
that no charges could be leveled against him. Compare with many in the
“ministry” who steal, lie, and live contrary to the law of God. It
becomes easy for the enemy to take them out by piercing their
breastplate, proving fatal to their ministry.

Consider the complete lack of ethics and responsibility in today’s
society — not only do we tolerate sin, we promote it. Read the list at
the end of Romans 1 and Galatians 5:19–21 and consider what most popular
movies contain.

As we’ve covered in the belt of truth, truth
does not change, sin is *always* sin, wrong is still wrong, yet how many
times do you hear the following:

* It’s not your fault, you have a disease
* You were born that way

Where has responsibility gone?

Our society spends considerable time trying to blame others for our own
problems. Very few people even live a “moral” (whatever that means) life
anymore. People devoted to their spouse and honest on their tax returns
are the butt of comedians jokes.

Consider what passes for TV — the guy everyone laughs at is the honest,
hard-working father who provides for his family. Hollywood prefers to
portray dads as a stupid, inept, drunk.

Hollywood is nothing more than a mirror for society, as most people
consider loyalty and personal integrity an outdated concept applying
only to old-timers.

Paul has a different idea.

> I, therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you to walk worthy of
> the calling with which you were called, with all lowliness and
> gentleness, with longsuffering, bearing with one another in love,
> endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
> (Ephesians 4:1–3 NKJV)

*Worthy of the calling*. How often do you think of that? Do you need a
daily [reminder of moral codes](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2013/08/19/what-strengthens-and-weakens-our-integrity-part-iv-the-power-of-moral-reminders/)?

> LORD, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell in thy holy
> hill? He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and
> speaketh the truth in his heart. He that backbiteth not with his
> tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbor, nor taketh up a reproach
> against his neighbor. In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he
> honoreth them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt,
> and changeth not. He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor
> taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall
> never be moved. (Psalm 15)

He that lives up to his word, and changes not?

We come to those words nobody likes to hear anymore.

* Duty
* Honor
* Commitment
* Integrity
* Honesty
* Trust
* Self-Control

Those old-fashioned ideals come straight from the Bible — it’s the
breastplate of righteousness. It’s no coincidence as society throws out
God and the Bible those ideals have vanished.

How’s your breastplate doing? Does it have a few holes? If it does, the
time to repair it is *now*.

Don’t worry about what you’ve *done* (past tense), concern yourself with
what you’re *doing* (present and future). As Zig Ziglar says “failure is
an event, *not a person*.” It matters not what your past contains since
you can’t change it, it matters what you do with what lies in front of
you.

Focus on what you’re *doing*, not what you’ve *done.*

… Because it’s 2:59AM.
