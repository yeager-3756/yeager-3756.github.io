One issue arising when you tell someone you take the Bible seriously is
they’ll bring up all the Old Testament Mosaic law and tell you you can’t
eat ham or play football (since it’s pigskin), sine rules forbidding
those activities are found in the Old Testament. Such an argument
provides an example of the logical error of false choice.

1.  If you say you don’t follow Mosaic law and eat ham you’ll be accused
    of not following the Bible seriously as you claim.
2.  If you do follow it you’ll be accused of all sorts of strange
    things, and likely they’ll find *something* you don’t follow.

It’s a *false choice* — in other words those aren’t the only
possibilities.

It’s not a new issue, as the early church dealt with it in Acts 15 and
concluded Christians don’t have to follow the Mosaic law. Certainly
*principles* in the Old Testament are found in the New Testament
(forbidding adultery, etc), but as a Christian you don’t have to worry
about obeying the Sabbath.

The confusion arises as some ideas like sexual immorality are repeated
and binding on Christians, while others are Mosaic law only and
Christians are freed from them (see also Peter in Acts 10).

The same line of thought also comes from liberal “Christians” who want
to ignore certain parts of what the church has been taught in the New
Testament. If you eat ham, then you’re picking out only what you want,
so we can throw out anything else as well, they’ll say, like sexual
immorality, qualifications of church leaders, and so on.

Wrong. It’s another tactic of rebellion. Yes, you can take
your Bible seriously and not be caught up in Mosaic Law, without being
contradictory.

It’s simply theology 101.
