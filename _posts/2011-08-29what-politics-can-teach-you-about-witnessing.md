Politics will always be a rough-and-tumble business with heated debates
and strong emotions. However, if you’re going to engage in political
discussion (and you *should* as a steward of the country), you must be
prepared to take advantage of any situation which presents itself.

Here’s an example of an [unforced error](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/unforced+error), as a Tea
Party person received some one-on-one time with the President.

<blockquote cite="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/08/15/obama-conversation-with-tea-partier-gets-heated/">
<p>President Obama got into a heated back-and-forth Monday with a Tea Party activist who demanded to know at the end of a town hall meeting here whether Vice President Biden had called Tea Partiers “terrorists” during the debt ceiling debate on Capitol&nbsp;Hill.</p>
<p>Obama did say he would discuss the matter further with Rhodes, founder of the Iowa Tea Party, after the event. And the duo was spotted in an animated conversation a few moments&nbsp;later.</p>
</blockquote>

Let’s **suppose you got some time with the President — is this the
*single* issue** you’d bring up? The most important? We hope not.

In tennis you’d call this an unforced error — opportunity wasted.

The Political Side
------------------

Politics is serious stuff, and **if the Tea Party wants to play with the
big boys, it’s time to grow up**, and rule number one is: when you get
time with the President, be prepared and get to the *big* issues.

What did anyone expect the President to say: “Yes he said it, and I
agree, so tough on you”. Really? When backed into a corner, a politician
reverts to his nature: deny, deflect, and
[obfuscate](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/obfuscate) (confuse).

**If you’re going to play big-boy games, you’d better bring your “A”
game**. That means be prepared, avoid logical errors,
learn how to discuss and debate, and be polite and civil.

The Practical Side — Lessons to Learn
-------------------------------------

**Be prepared to take advantage of every available opportunity** — thus
you must be *prepared* for opportunities when they present themselves,
or as has been said “The harder I practice, the luckier I get” (quote
attributed to many people) and be *bold* when doors open — don’t make
unforced errors by wasting opportunities.

**Preparedness takes work, so bring your lunch-box** and hard-hat, roll
up your selves, and get ready, as Paul reminds us in the armor of God to
“gird your loins”, which means *be prepared for action and movement*.
It’s time to step up to the majors. You can do it.

Walter Martin spoke on “The Baptism of Boldness”. For those who can’t
watch the video, here’s a small excerpt:

> We’re suffering from an endemic disease. This disease in the Christian
> world is known by its Latin name, non-rock-a-boatus. What it really
> means is, “Whatever you do, don’t rock the boat.” The cure for this
> disease is a baptism of boldness.
>
> … You may be thinking, “You seem pretty uptight about this, Dr.
> Martin.” And I am, because we need to get rid of this
> non-rock-a-boatus mentality that is so prevalent in this country. The
> apostle Paul in 2 Timothy 4:2 doesn’t hesitate to talk about the
> things that concern him. He says, “I charge you therefore before God
> and the Lord Jesus Christ who will judge the living and the dead and
> is appearing in his kingdom, preach the word; be ready in season and
> out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with great patience
> and instruction.”
>
> Do you know there are Christians running around today waiting for a
> convenient moment to “preach the word” that never comes? And the
> reason it never comes is because **God doesn’t care about convenience;
> God cares about obedience**. So you preach the Word, whether it’s
> convenient or inconvenient, “in season” or “out of season.”
