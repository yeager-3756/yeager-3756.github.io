The agnostic-atheist — a term basically meaning agnostic (no reason to
believe in God), likely used because more people have heard of atheism
than agnosticism. We generally ask if people are really atheist or
agnostic — if they’re truly atheist and claim no god exists, they accept
it on faith, not logic or proof so we don’t have much to discuss as
their position stems from faith; no amount of reason, logic, or critical
thinking can shake their dedication to their dogma.

But if a person is agnostic (even if they mistakenly call it atheism)
we’ve got something to discuss — they believe god doesn’t exist, not as
an absolute decree by fiat, but because they don’t see evidence or any
reason to believe. We certainly disagree with their conclusions, but at
least they’re using rational logic, something the true atheist lacks in
their dogmatic claim of “there is no God”.

In short, atheism is illogical and nonsense, at least if you’re agnostic
you’ve got some reasoned logic behind your statement — logic and
critical thinking the atheist lacks.
