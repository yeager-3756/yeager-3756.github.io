The parables in Matthew 13 can be misunderstood to state the church will
grow and influence the world, and everyone lives happily ever after.
Thus, it’s the church’s job to “help” God along in that task, usually
via government programs. Some even go so far as to state it’s our job to
establish God’s kingdom, again, usually by using extreme political
ideology like social justice.

But consider what Jesus *actually* said in Matthew 13:

> Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven
> is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his
> field. Which indeed is the least of all seeds; but when it is grown,
> it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds
> of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof. Another parable
> spoke he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a
> woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was
> leavened. (Matthew 13:31–33)

Whoops. Notice who the birds are? They’re not the good guys.

It might surprise some to learn the church won’t be pure — heretics will
infest it. Not just obvious cultists, but mainline denominations and
popular pastors will promote heresy as they abandon orthodox Biblical
doctrine.

What?

Have you heard the current fad of “the gospel of social justice”?
That’s one example of a popular fad (promoted by supposedly trusted
pastors) which turns out to be 100% incorrect.

You see, Paul *defined* the Gospel in 1 Corinthians 15, so if someone
uses a different gospel like social justice and good works, they’re
telling you one of several things:

-   Paul was wrong.
-   They’re a new prophet who can overrule the Bible.
-   Paul didn’t really mean what he wrote, it must be re-interpreted.
-   That part doesn’t apply today.
-   The Bible isn’t really God’s Word.
-   … or some other equally absurd nonsense.

Of course, when you call them on it, they’ll be slippery and try to
squirm out of the problem created by placing radical political ideology
over the Bible, but nevertheless facts remain: they substitute their own
idea for God’s Word — simply ask *why* their idea should overrule Paul.

They’ll revert to traditional Christian words, but you *must get them to
define them*. You’ll quickly discover when discussing the Gospel, for
example, liberals aren’t using the same definition as orthodox
Christianity.

No doubt heretics and apostates infect the church. Jesus Himself warned
heretics will infest the church — the birds remember, are workers of
Satan, and leaven normally refers to sin and corruption.

Liberal theology.
Workers of Satan. Re-interpretation. Modern scholarship. Leaven. Social
justice. Corruption. All birds of the same flock.

We’ve been warned, but are we doing anything? Are we worried about
being offended instead of using truth?

We’re not talking about minor points — pre-trib, methods of baptism,
etc. No, what concerns us is *foundational* doctrine — the Gospel — and
it ain’t social justice, good works, common good, modern theology, or
pot-lucks. Denying the Biblical Gospel removes Christianity from …
Christianity.

The Gospel is Jesus Christ as God became a man, died on the cross for
our sin, and was resurrected the third day.

Yet liberals reject some or all Paul’s definition, even as Paul himself
warned some people will not accept Biblical doctrine.

> For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but
> according to their own desires, because they have itching ears, they
> will heap up for themselves teachers; and they will turn their ears
> away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables. (2 Timothy 4:3-4)

What do we see today in the church? The popular book-of-the-month.
Philosophy. Re-interpretation of the Bible. Abandonment of truth.
Seeker-friendly.

Certainly these fads can be popular, but that’s not the question. The
question will always be: are they *true*? And the answer is if they
contradict the Bible, they most assuredly are false, and heresy as well.

The church has been warned, but will we heed the warning, or allow the
leaven of liberal theology to corrupt the church?
