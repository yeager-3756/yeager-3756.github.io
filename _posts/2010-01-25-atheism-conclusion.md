So here’s the train of thought — agree or disagree as you wish:

1.  Evolution doesn’t work. Even Dawkins admits an outside force is required.
2.  Thus, a god exists.
3.  That candidate god *must* explain the creation of the universe.
4.  Exclude all candidates not meeting criteria.
5.  Examine the remaining and decide for yourself.

Consider Pascal’s wager — *IF* a God exists and you reject Him, you’ve got everything to lose. But if you accept God and live a “moral” (whatever that means) life and God doesn’t exist, you’ve lost what?
