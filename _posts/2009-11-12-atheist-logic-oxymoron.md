Some atheists finally admit the logical absurdity of stating “There is
no God”, but attempt to weasel out of the problem by claiming
*practically* we can state there is no God (or, almost certainly there
is no God), because they don’t have proof meeting their requirements.
Here’s one attempt at such an argument — see if you can spot the logical
error before reading the answer.

<blockquote cite="http://atheism.about.com/b/2009/10/27/comment-of-the-week-religious-education-vs-reality-based-education.htm#comment-6">
<p>Logically speaking a general claim “god exists” can’t be refuted
(until there are specifics and I have some idea what “god” is supposed
to represent). But from a practical reality standpoint of what is and
what is not, it’s perfectly reasonable to assert something does not
exist in the absence of any evidence for the existence of that item.
In other words, if I say to you “Grab my notebook off the coffee table
for me,” and you look and there is a mug and a coaster, but no
notebook on the table, it is absolutely reasonable for you to respond,
“There is no notebook on the table.”</p>
<p>Nobody would assert that simply from an absence of evidence you are
being illogical to conclude the notebook isn’t there—simply because
there is no evidence of a notebook on the table.</p>
</blockquote>

Get it? Read it again.

Yet another atheist logical error. To use the notebook-and-table example
to reference God would have to go something like this:

* “Grab my notebook”.
* “There’s no notebook on the coffee table” (It must not exist).
* “No, it’s on the office desk upstairs”.
* “Sorry, I hadn’t considered that”.

Of course, the answer comes from a place you failed to consider, or
exists outside your knowledge. Using the notebook argument with God is
quite different, as God can exist throughout the entire cosmos, while
the notebook doesn’t — it’s not the same argument at all. Using limited
knowledge to falsely extrapolate to the whole (which you *didn’t* have
knowledge of) is a logical error (unless you assume uniformitarianism).

Once again, atheism’s position comes from faith, not logic or critical
thinking. You can believe it, but no amount of verbal twister changes
the claim into a logical statement. Atheism (“There is no God”) requires
faith. You can *believe* there is no God, fine. But to state it as fact?
And belittle those not accepting your dogma, presuppositions, and faith?
All while claiming superior intellectual and logical skills (while
holding a logically absurd position)?

Atheists miss the irony.

Some atheists are really agnostic — they don’t have a *reason* to
believe in God. Those people exist on reasonable logical ground the
atheist lacks, even if their conclusion is faulty. But you can’t be a
true atheist and at the same time expound on your logic and intellectual
prowess — it’s a contradiction.

If atheists could just admit their position comes from faith, without
proof, and based on hope (not critical thinking), we could progress to
more interesting questions.

But if you follow the new atheists it’s not likely to happen, as they
continue blissfully unaware of their contradictions and logical blunders
inherent in their position, all while making fun of others and claiming
atheists hold the intellectual high ground, while at the same time
clinging to an unprovable, illogical dogma.
