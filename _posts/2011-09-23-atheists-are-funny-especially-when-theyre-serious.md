Al Stefanelli (Georgia State Director of American Atheists) sure stepped
in it big time, and displayed for all the world atheism’s complete lack
of understanding logic and critical thinking.

On a recent blog post he used a graphic with the text “NOTICE:
Intolerance will not be tolerated”. Thinking that must be a joke (surely
an atheist promoting logic and critical thinking would immediately
notice the absurdity of that statement), when reading his post it turns
out it wasn’t really a joke, as Mr. Stefanelli writes:

<blockquote cite="http://atheists.org/blog/2011/09/14/taking-the-gloves-off">
<p>The dictionary defines intolerance as lack of toleration, an unwillingness or refusal to tolerate or respect. Sometimes, though, it becomes quite necessary. <b>Intolerance toward beliefs and doctrines</b> that serve only to promote hatred, bigotry and discrimination <b>should be lauded</b>, as should extremist points of view toward the eradication of these beliefs and doctrines.</p>
<p>… <b>many of them are sociopaths</b> and quite a good number of them are psychopaths. All of them are clearly delusional.</p>
</blockquote>

Stunning. He’s actually trying to make the laughable, wonderfully
logically absurd statement **intolerance should be eliminated … except
if it’s *his* intolerance**, in which case it’s not only good, but
everyone else should join his extremist intolerance as he continues
“anyone who agrees with this needs to adopt extremist points of view
that includes the intolerance of their very existence” (with the ’their’
referring to various religions Mr. Stefanelli fears).

So Mr. Stefanelli is against extreme intolerance … unless it’s *his*,
and then, by gosh, everyone should be for extreme intolerance!

**A prime example of a lack of critical thinking and logic**, and a
perfect example of cognitive dissonance (holding contradictory ideas
simultaneously — Orwell called it DoubleThink). We’ll ignore the
stunning (and obvious) ignorance of logic Mr Stefanelli displays to get
to a more serious problem.

Using his own twisted view of “tolerance”, **He wants to eradicate the
religions of Christianity and Islam**.

Of course, actual **tolerant people allow differing opinions**, and
openly and civilly discuss them — tolerance toward others Mr. Stefanelli
lacks. We certainly disagree with his extreme intolerance.

There’s nothing wrong with being an atheist and God-denier, any more than
believing in the moon landing hoax, or the Easter bunny. If that’s your
belief system, fine. But please, can’t we be tolerant of others? Is it
not possible for Mr. Stefanelli to engage in civil discourse?

But *why does he get to choose* — **since he’s already admitted he’s
intolerant, why is his intolerance acceptable**, while he claims other
intolerance not acceptable? Simply put, who died and made him king? Even
Richard Dawkins admits atheist morality isn’t absolute, so the real
issue is why is he the sole arbitrator?

Of course intolerant atheists
aren’t new, and he’s certainly not the first, nor will be the last. The
problem is where does he get his morality from? Atheism has no basis for morality,
a point even Richard Dawkins notes.

Atheists **continually demonstrate a lack of critical thinking and
logic**. Perhaps the American Atheists should attempt to find a leader
who doesn’t express such logically challenged and intolerant ideas (it
certainly doesn’t make atheism look good to express such extremism).

We shouldn’t be too hard on Mr Stefanelli, after all, his worldview of
atheism is by definition illogical, so promoting other
bizarre atheist “logic” shouldn’t be surprising, since atheism’s entire
belief dogma is built on a stunning lack of critical thinking and logic,
after all atheist logic is an oxymoron.

Atheists say the funniest things… if they didn’t sadly display such
extremism and a total lack of logic.
