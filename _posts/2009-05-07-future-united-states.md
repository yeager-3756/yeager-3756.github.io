Periodically you’ll find surveys which attempt to determine
just how many people follow each religion in the United States,
guessing about trends. A recent survey appeared in Newsweek,
with some interesting results:

> According to the American Religious Identification Survey that
>  got Mohler’s attention, the percentage of self-identified
>  Christians has fallen 10 percentage points since 1990, from
>  86 to 76 percent. The Jewish population is 1.2 percent; the
>  Muslim, 0.6 percent … Meanwhile, the number of people
>  willing to describe themselves as atheist or agnostic has
>  increased about fourfold from 1990 to 2009, from 1 million
>  to about 3.6 million. (That is about double the number of,
>  say, Episcopalians in the United States.)
>  [Newsweek](http://www.newsweek.com/id/192583)

So “Christians” have fallen 10 percentage points in 15 years,
according to this survey. Is the United States destined to
become as Europe, where God takes a back seat to secular
humanism, churches maintained only as relics of the past?

Many in this country and its government have openly stated the
desire to become more “Europe-like” — is this the future for
America? Or can the plunge toward the depths of Sodom and
Gomorrah be stopped? Some place the blame on government itself,
yet it’s important to remember we have *elected* representatives.
If the nation slouches toward Gomorrah, it’s because the people
tolerate it. If the nation be Godly, it’s because the people
demand it.

The problem isn’t in Washington (it’s only a reflection of the
disease); the real problem lies with the church which sits idly
by as the country abandons Godly principles, descending into
moral relativity and “everyone does what is right in their own
eyes” — as Bill Ritchie said “Without God, anything is possible”.

Yet if the survey is correct, three-quarters of the country
remains Christian. Imagine what would happen if each
demanded action?

> If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble
>  themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their
>  wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive
>  their sin, and will heal their land.
>  (2 Chronicles 7:14 KJV)

The problem isn’t the government or the President, it’s the
church, *we’ve* allowed it to happen. Government follows
society — if it abandons God, it’s because the people allow
it, and if it be Godly, it’s because the people demand it.

Where to begin to halt the slide away from God? First off, the
solution won’t be found in either of the political parties as
each travels down the same road — it doesn’t matter if you’re
on the left side of the road or the right side of the road as
the destination remains the same. It won’t be found in PAC’s or
waving signs. It’s a *spiritual* battle, and must be fought in
the spiritual realm.

1.  Study your Bible! Once or twice a week during church won’t
    get the job done.
2.  Study the Armor of God — you’ve got to understand and
    properly use the tools God’s given you. Start with our article
    on the [armor of God](/tags.html#series-the-armor-of-god)
    and then move
    on to further study.
3.  Get involved! Too many shun politics, yes it’s a dirty
    business, but if you’re not involved, you yield your influence
    to others. Make your opinion known, and support those
    candidates and positions espousing Biblical principles, and
    shun those failing to support Biblical principles. If 70% of
    the country followed that idea, the nation would turn around.
    This isn’t a plea for one political party over another, but a
    principle all Christians can agree on — support candidates
    (not just single political parties) holding Biblical principles.

Is it too late to halt the slide? No — Nineveh was 40 days
from destruction, and turned it around. It’s not too late, and
God does perform miracles. The problems in the United States
aren’t financial, or military, or even moral — they’re
*spiritual*, and need to be addressed spiritually.

If government abandons God, it’s because the people allow it,
and if it be Godly, it’s because the people demand it.
