Occasionally we stumble across (or someone recommends) a scholar touted
as the ultimate answer to rebut Christianity and promote (presumably)
atheism, or at the least the absurdity of Christianity. One such person
is Bart Ehrman, professor of Religious Studies at University of North
Carolina, Chapel Hill. One of his books discusses the problem of why
suffering exists, but let the review on his web site speak for itself:

Keep in mind a “renowned Bible scholar” teaching at a university should
(must) have a greater understanding of the text of the Bible, logic, and
other fundamental analysis skills than other people — it’s their
fiduciary duty — and should avoid basic mistakes in logic and analysis.
With that in mind, let’s examine his points and see how they stack up —
does the Bible offer competing explanations for suffering as Mr. Ehrman
proposes, or is his scholarship lacking?

> The prophets: suffering is a punishment for sin.

Without references it’s difficult to determine what he refers to.
However, it’s true sometimes sin can result in suffering (Luke 5) — the
problem comes when people equate *all* suffering with sin, and that’s
not true. So he’s partially correct in this point, *sometimes* sin
results in suffering. Of course, if he’s claiming suffering *always*
results from sin, he’s *way* off (Luke 13:4, Matt 5:45).

> The book of Job, which offers two different answers: suffering is a
> test, and you will be rewarded later for passing it; and suffering is
> beyond comprehension, since we are just human beings and God, after
> all, is God.

Suffering as a test? Were those the words of Job’s friends? It’s not
what God said — to see God’s view, read the last few chapters and you’ll
arrive at God’s explanation — I’m God, you’re not, where were you when
the foundation of the cosmos was laid? Do you have knowledge of each
star and planet? If not, it’s an admission God has knowledge you don’t.

> Ecclesiastes: suffering is the nature of things, so just accept it.

Written by Solomon giving man’s perspective, not God’s.

> All apocalyptic texts in both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament:
> God will eventually make right all that is wrong with the world.

That’s a bit vague, but in general correct. Man’s sin caused the decay
we see in the world, and at the proper moment the corruption caused by
it will be corrected.

So, if Mr. Ehrman wants to know what the Bible says about suffering,
he’s somewhat correct in that several perspectives exist, but some of
them are man’s, and some God’s — equating the two causes confusion (even
for a “renowned Bible scholar”). If Mr. Ehrman wants to understand why
suffering exists, he’d be wise to ignore man’s thoughts (which may or
may not be correct), and focus on what *God* said. Perhaps if he did,
his confusion would clear.

Perhaps Bible Scholar Ehrman doesn’t know some parts of the Bible relate
historical accounts, and just because something appears in the Bible
doesn’t mean God *approves* of it, or it represents His view. The Bible
contains historical accounts of sexual immorality, murder, lying,
deception, and more, but that doesn’t mean it’s God *promoting* (or
approving) those actions. Thus Mr. Ehrman’s confusion stems (in part)
from failing to distinguish man’s views from God’s in the Bible — a
surprising fundamental error from a “renowned Bible scholar” teaching at
a University.

Some will say we haven’t read the book, so we should not comment. But
with several basic analysis and logic errors in the book summary what
could the remainder of the book hold? Attempting to build a skyscraper
on a shaky foundation never yields quality results. Additionally, if we
purchased all the books people wanted us to, we’d have to get a second
(or third) job to pay for it. If Mr. Ehrman sends a copy (it would be
nice if he signed it as well), we’d read it. But otherwise, *paying* for
reading a book which by it’s own admission provides no answers *and*
contains basic Biblical analysis (and other logical) errors is not a
profitable way to spend our time.

We’re left with God’s view on suffering — first, He’s God and has vastly
more knowledge and wisdom. If we don’t understand why events occur, that
should not surprise us as He’s God, we’re not. If God is God, then God
is God — how big is *your* God? If you have the same knowledge as He, is
He really God? Or just something you keep in a box for emergencies?

Second, God’s plan *will* run to completion, and if you read the back of
the book for the answers, you’ll see it all works out in the end. *How*
we get from point “A” to point “B” is unclear, but eventually we *do*
get to point “B”.

> And we know that all things work together for good to those who love
> God, to those who are the called according to His purpose. (Romans 8:28 KJV)

So, you many not *like* what God has to say about suffering, and you may
wish for more understanding, but now you’re spared reading 294 pages
which fail to provide answers.

*If* God exists, by definition He knows more than we do, so why would it
surprise us if we don’t understand some things God does? Rejecting ideas
*we* don’t understand places a huge realm of thought off-limits — and
isn’t part of a university education involve exploring ideas with an
open mind? Again, it’s surprising a University scholar makes such
basic errors.

Be careful upon hearing “scholars” making wild claims — they may sound
scholarly, but don’t be fooled by scholarly language. The Deutero-Isaiah
hypothesis, Documentary Hypothesis, Who Wrote Daniel and more all
contain “scholarly” wisdom you may be trapped by, but in the end contain
such basic errors you don’t need to spend your time with them, and
they’re best left on the garbage heap of pseudo-scholarship.

> Because that, when they knew God, they glorified Him not as God,
> neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and
> their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise,
> they became fools, (Romans 1:21–22 KJV)

Beware of pseudo-scholarship — no matter how many Phd’s and other
initials appear behind a name, or how many books published, or awards
and stature, scholarship sometimes turns out to be pseudo-scholarship —
Physicist Richard Feynman said if an argument can’t be made simple, it
means we really don’t understand it — don’t be fooled by volumes of
“scholarship” hiding a lack of understanding (in Physics we called that
a [hand-waving](/tags.html#handwaving) argument).
