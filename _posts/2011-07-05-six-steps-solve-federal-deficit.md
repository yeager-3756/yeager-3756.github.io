Like everything in Washington, spending and the deficit is political. No
sane person denies the Obama deficit is a staggering problem and must be
dealt with, the difference is some people want to deal with it now,
others want to ignore it until later. Who understands the seriousness of
the problem? This was said on the Senate floor:

<blockquote cite="http://www.c-spanvideo.org/videoLibrary/clip.php?appid=595743129">
<p>In fact, <b>when it comes to deficits, this President owns all the records</b>. The three largest deficits in our Nation’s history have all occurred under this administration’s watch. The deterioration of the Federal Government’s finances is the direct result of the misguided priorities of this administration&nbsp;…</p>
<p>These <b>deficits have resulted in an unprecedented and dangerous borrowing</b> spree. The total debt during this spree has grown by trillions of dollars. President Abraham Lincoln said: As an individual who undertakes to live by borrowing soon finds his original means devoured by interest and next no one left to borrow from, so must it be with&nbsp;government.</p>
<p>Given the explosion of debt in recent years, <b>it is long past time for Washington to change the course and adopt a new fiscal policy</b>. After all, the future of our economy and our Nation is at&nbsp;stake.</p>
</blockquote>

That was Senator Harry Reid. Yep, *that* Harry Reid.

Of course, he was referring to President Bush, not Obama. No doubt
President Bush’s biggest flaw was spending, but the increasing Federal Deficit
under Obama has been breathtaking — tripling the deficit Mr. Reid said
leads to a “dangerous borrowing spree”.

Why the silence over Obama tripling the deficit, Senator? Why, the fact
Obama is a Democrat has nothing to do with it, we’re sure.

That’s the reality in Washington — pure partisan politics. When it’s
someone of the same party an action is fine, when it’s the other party
those same actions result in Armageddon. Nothing but partisanship and a
lack of integrity.

Can the Obama Deficit be Solved?
--------------------------------

As reckless spending skyrockets, it’s obvious to any sane person we
can’t tax our way out of it. It requires serious effort to trim spending
— in the order of yearly $500 Billion in reductions *to start*. Can it
be done? Or does anyone in Washington have the integrity to do it?

Obama’s deficit (in nice round numbers) is $1.5 Trillion, or $1,500
Billion. We need to cut 1,500 Billion dollars *per year* before we can
even begin to pay back the accumulated debt. Can it be done?

1.  **Immediate budget reduction of $400 Billion, with additional $100
    Billion in years 2, 3 and 4**. Total yearly Savings: $700 Billion —
    not quite half of Obama’s deficit. Note that current talks are
    considerably smaller amounts, indicating none of the clowns in
    Washington are really serious.
2.  **End Corporate Welfare**. That means oil, gas, ethanol, “green”
    subsidies, farm, PBS, National Endowment for the Arts, NPR, Planned
    Parenthood, GM, Chrysler, union paybacks, preferential treatment to
    political cronies, and more. ALL of them should go. No bailouts, no
    rescues, no welfare, no backroom paybacks.
3.  **Tax Increases**. The problem becomes when Democrats talk of “soak
    the rich” it really means people with incomes above $200,000 — the
    middle class. What Democrats don’t tell you is we can’t tax our way
    out. You could take *ALL* income above $100,000 and cover the
    deficit, but how much damage would that do to the economy? However,
    increasing to say 40% on income over $1 Million and 45% on income
    over $2 Million would make a *small* dent in Obama’s deficit.
4.  **Eliminate Tax Welfare**. This means items like EIC and other
    “refundable” tax credits, which are really welfare disguised as tax
    policy. Obama calls this “spending in the tax code”, and it’s
    welfare, pure and simple. If you want welfare, man up and have the
    guts to call it what it is; don’t be an economic [girlie
    man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girlie_men) and hide your
    socialist ideas in the tax code.
5.  **Elimination of Federal bureaucracies** like the Department of
    Education. Have they really accomplished anything except the
    lowering of standards and test scores? Let’s be honest, that
    department has been a dismal failure; only Washington rewards such
    stunning incompetence, it’s time to scrap failed ideas,
    not reward them with more money.
6.  **Balanced Budget Amendment**. Washington has shown they’re not
    capable of controlling themselves.

After that, we *might* get back to deficits of the Bush era. It will
take economic growth to solve the rest. Only after we get a balanced
budget can we begin to pay back the $14 Trillion we owe.

Nero fiddled while Rome burned; the President plays golf while the
country rushes toward collapse — the [Cloward-Piven strategy]({% post_url 2010-07-03-cloward-piven-strategy %})
run right before our eyes — the only logical reason Washington and the
President refuse to solve the debt problem is *because they don’t want
to*. Think that sounds crazy? Do some research on the Cloward-Piven
strategy and see for at least some in Washington, economic collapse *is*
the desired outcome.
