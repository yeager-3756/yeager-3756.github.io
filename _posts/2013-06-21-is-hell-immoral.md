The idea a loving God would *never* send people to hell leads to
incorrect conclusions. First, hell isn’t in the Bible, or second,
everyone will be saved (universal salvation). The typical argument goes
like this “There is no support in the Bible for the morally repugnant
idea that hell is an actual place to which God sentences people to spend
eternity in mortal agony.”

Several mistakes exist in that single sentence, but the most important
being “God sentences people to spend eternity in mortal agony.”

Really?

The truth remains simple: You don’t *have* to go to hell *unless you
want to*, and that’s the most important idea: **Nobody will be in hell
unless they choose to be**.

Nobody believes man is a perfect creature, thus sin exists. The question
is, what should be done about it? Ignore it? Or require justice?

The idea justice can exist without “paying your debt to society” does
not exist in any civilized society, and it certainly doesn’t exist with
God. Sin and transgression requires a penalty to be paid, and more
important *a just God can’t exist without it*.

Everyone is guilty before God and deserving of death, but God provided a
way out *if you want to take it*. God doesn’t *send* anyone to hell,
they *choose* to go.

God is pro-choice!

These same people would scream if God *didn’t* give them a choice.
That’s not fair! God is making me be with Him! No, He’s not. You get to
choose.

What is *not* available is avoiding the consequences of your choices. If
you rob a bank, you’ll likely end up in prison (justice). If you sin,
you’ll likely end up in a place you don’t want to be, unless you accept
the substitution available to you.

**A loving and just God can’t be any other way**. Hell isn’t immoral,
rather it’s God giving you a choice. You can choose light, love, peace,
and happiness. Or not. If you choose not, God gives you want you want —
a place where none of those characteristics exist (hell).
