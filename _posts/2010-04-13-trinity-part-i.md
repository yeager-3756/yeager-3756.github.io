One concept causing problems for new believers and various other groups
is the concept of the trinity — one God revealing Himself in three
persons. Many groups deny the trinity, as they deny the deity of Jesus
Himself, which causes problems in the Bible.

We’ll consider the trinity in two parts. First, we’ll consider a
Biblical problem which only can be solved by the trinity — if you reject
the trinity the Bible contains an error as you consider these two verses
in John’s gospel.

> If I bear witness of Myself, My witness is not true. (John 5:31 NKJV)
>
> Even if I bear witness of Myself, My witness is true (John 8:14 NKJV)

Whoops! The Pharisees jumped on these two statements (as any good
skeptic would) as a contradiction. But of course it’s not as the Bible
has no errors. So what’s going on? The answer appears later in
John’s gospel:

> It is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is true.
> I am One who bears witness of Myself, and the Father who sent Me bears
> witness of Me. (John 8:17–18 NKJV)
>
> I and My Father are one. (John 10:30 NKJV)

*If* Jesus bears witness of Himself, it’s not true. But since God is a
trinity (three in one), He *doesn’t* bear witness by Himself, as the
Father also testifies of Him. One God, but three distinct persons. In
John 5 Jesus refers back to the Mosaic law which said one witness was
insufficient to establish a matter. However, due to the trinity, in John
8 Jesus *can* speak Himself, as both he and the Father testify of Him.

Thus, Jesus can say in John chapter 8 His witness *is* true. However,
for those groups rejecting the idea of the trinity, you’ve got quite a
problem to explain.

> Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one! (Deuteronomy. 6:4)

Next time, we’ll dive into the phrase “God is light”, and de-mystify the
trinity with a physical example.
