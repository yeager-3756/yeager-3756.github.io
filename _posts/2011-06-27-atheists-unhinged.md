New York wants to memorialize seven firefighters who died on 9/11 (a
good thing) by renaming a street “Seven in Heaven Way”. Who could have a
problem with that? Enter stage left, atheists trying to stamp out all
religion based on *their* illogical and unprovable dogma. Where’s
the tolerance?

<blockquote cite="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/06/21/new-york-atheists-angry-over-heaven-street-sign-honoring-11victims/">
<p>“There should be no signage or displays of religious nature in the public domain,” said Ken Bronstein, president of New York City Atheists. “It’s really insulting to us.”</p>
</blockquote>

Mr. Bronstein’s view isn’t correct, the first amendment isn’t freedom
*from* it’s freedom *to*, involving *Congress* and creating *law*. Could
Mr. Bronstein cite which Federal law Congress created when New York
named this street? Of course not — he’s factually wrong on the first amendment.

We’ve written on separation of church and state
before; note Mr. Bronstein isn’t alone in his misunderstanding of the first amendment,
as the atheist version reads:

> No person shall have any expression of religion in public, and it’s
> acceptable to prohibit the free exercise thereof …

… which bears little resemblance to the *actual* First Amendment:

> **Congress** shall **make no law** respecting an establishment of
> religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof …

How do atheists morph “Congress” into “any citizen or locality” and
change “law” to “any expression”? Any casual reading of the actual text
demonstrates the absurdities of the atheist position. Of course, since
atheism is logically absurd (the moon landing hoax theories having more
credibility than atheism), it shouldn’t surprise anyone atheists
continually demonstrate a lack of critical thinking and logic, and
defend a closed mind.

Ironically (and Mr. Bronstein and his fellow atheists miss it), his view
of “no displays of religious nature” (if mandated by Federal courts)
*is* a violation of the first amendment, as it prohibits the free
exercise of religion.

Why do atheists insist on forcing their illogical faith on the rest of
the country? A hope they can’t prove and take on *faith*, not logic,
critical thinking, or facts. Why can’t they be freethinkers, remain
open-minded, and be tolerant?

Questions the atheists themselves can’t answer; their continued attempts
to force their faith onto everyone else demonstrates a case of cognitive
dissonance (holding two conflicting ideas at the same time, what Orwell
called “Doublethink”) — as they *hope* God doesn’t exist.

Why can’t atheists be tolerant?
