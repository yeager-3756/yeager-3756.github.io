Many people don’t grasp the First Amendment. We hope this person doesn’t actually feel all the hatred and vitriol he
writes, so we’ll give him the benefit of the doubt and ignore the
obvious poor expression and try to get to the idea itself, rather than
the way he expressed it.

<blockquote cite="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-l-weinstein/fundamentalist-christian-_b_3072651.html">
<p>I founded the civil rights fighting organization the Military Religious Freedom Foundation (MRFF) to do one thing: fight those monsters who would tear down the Constitutionally-mandated wall separating church and state in the technologically most lethal entity ever created by humankind, the U.S. military.</p>
<p>Today, we face incredibly well-funded gangs of fundamentalist Christian monsters who terrorize their fellow Americans by forcing their weaponized and twisted version of Christianity upon their helpless subordinates in our nation’s armed forces.</p>

First, he’s wildly ignorant of the First Amendment. Just where is this
wall he speaks of? Perhaps a review of the First Amendment is in order.

> Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
> prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of
> speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to
> assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

Oops. Sorry, the “wall of separation” doesn’t exist. The First Amendment
says two things about religion:

1.  Congress can’t enforce a national religion.
2.  Congress can’t restrict freedom of religion.

Sorry, but no wall of separation exists, or was intended. The author
makes a huge mistake (or simply is uneducated). It’s freedom *of*
religion, not freedom *from*.

As our society moves toward a whiny, entitlement, victim mentality,
views similar to what the author expresses become more common: “I don’t
like to hear this, so it’s offensive, therefore is should be banned or
censored.”

That attitude lacks understanding in a free society. Freedom does *not*
mean you’ll never hear something you don’t agree with. It means everyone
can make their case for their position.

If the Hare Krishna’s want to pass out flowers at the airport, that’s
fine and a protected display of their freedom of religion. You may or
may not agree with them, but it’s their right to state their case;
freedom does not mean citizens won’t hear ideas they don’t agree with.

Of course, when people have a phobia like God-fear, they want to push
their fears and phobias on to the rest of society. That’s a perversion
of freedom.

The author is free to make his anti-God rant as he wishes; a free
society *never* wants to silence discussion and debate. Of course, the
method the author uses isn’t necessarily productive to civilized
discussion.

<p>If these fundamentalist Christian monsters of human degradation, marginalization, humiliation and tyranny cannot broker or barter your acceptance of their putrid theology, then they crave for your universal silence in the face of their rapacious reign of theocratic terror.</p>
</blockquote>

Wrong again — he’s free to spout any nonsense he likes (some of the
commentators did see through his ideas, however. It’s nice to see even
on a far-left site like HuffPo, at least a few people still believe in
expressing your ideas in civilized discussion and debate).

<p>Wow. This is one of the most poorly written articles I have read in a long time. While some of the points made have some merit, the ad hominem attacks undermine any legitimate argument. </p>
</blockquote>

But know this, Christians are *not* in a protected class. As just *one*
example, in 2009 an article appeared titled [Did Christianity Cause the Crash](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/12/did-christianity-cause-the-crash/307764/)?
Never heard of it? Not surprising.

Now, imagine if the article said, did Islam cause the crash? It would be
national news.

Both are wrong, yet only one would be news or a scandal. That’s called
bias, and most media has perfected it.

The fact this author can rant about Christians, yet generate little
criticism for wildly bizarre ideas, proves Christianity doesn’t exist
with other “protected” groups. Make no mistake, rants like the author’s
are more frequent, and as long as directed at non-protected groups,
those rants are ignored.

A time will soon come when you’ll be forced — like Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abednego — to make a choice. Will you stand up, or fold like a cheap
lawn chair? It’s your choice.

… because as Mr Weinstein’s article proves, it’s 2:59 AM.
