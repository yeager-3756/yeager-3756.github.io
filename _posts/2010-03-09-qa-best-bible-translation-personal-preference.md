The Bible translation debate continues to create questions — how do you
pick a translation to use? Are they really different?

It’s *not* a personal preference issue. Since the two textual bases
differ, at most one is correct (or they’re both wrong). For example, if
you say the sky is orange and I say it’s blue, I’m right and you’re
wrong. If you say it’s orange and I say it’s purple we’re both wrong.
But we can’t both be right in either case.

It’s not the KJV, it’s Textus Receptus verses the Alexandrian base text.

Since Textus Receptus and Alexandrian texts differ, they can’t *both* be
correct. As to the Alexandrian base (today usually referred to as
Westcott/Hort, Nestle/Aland, or UBS) we have an extensive [article on Bible translation]({% post_url 2009-01-01-which-bible-translation-best %})
detailing these issues (it’s also available as a PDF).

It might surprise you to know many seminaries and/or pastors deny the
virgin birth, resurrection, return of Jesus, and more. These so-called
“modern translations” frequently follow those liberal theological ideas
as they abandon orthodox Christianity. Westcott-Hort denied the creation
and Eden, believed themselves Christs, and more.

Whatever you may think about textual analysis, the Bible translation
discussion is most definitely *not* simply personal preference. *All*
translations have problems, whether you use KJV, NKJV, NASB or NIV
understand *how* your translation came to be, *what* textual base was
used, and *why* they translators chose what they did.
