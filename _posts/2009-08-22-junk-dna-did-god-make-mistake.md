summary: People confuse the idea God makes mistakes with their lack of understanding. But always when more becomes known, it turns out God was right all along.

So-called [Junk DNA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junk_DNA) obtains it’s
name because it appears to serve no purpose. If God created the cosmos,
the atheist claims, why put useless code in the DNA?

As we’ve talked about before, it’s the argument about vestigial organs
all over again. Only problem, we’re finding out [they’re not so useless]({% post_url 2009-08-06-useless-organs-really-arent %})
after all. The problem stems from hubris — the idea if *we* don’t see a
purpose, it must be worthless, or “junk”. Naturally, that pre-supposes
evolution and a lack of a deity, but adherence to strict dogma instead
of experimental evidence never bothered science before.

So what about junk DNA? A theory proposes it’s really about
[meta-programming](http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/metaprogramming-and-dna/).
Most programs manipulate and output data, while
[meta-programming](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-metaprog1.html)
outputs other programs. It’s a program writing a program, instead of
data. Why do this? In short, at runtime you might not know exactly what
needs to be done — the program may need to vary depending on external
inputs known only as the program executes.

So what to do? Have the program write code, and then execute the created
code. That’s meta-programming from 20,000 feet.

Because we don’t see a function for parts of the DNA code, could it be
used in other ways we don’t see right now? Perhaps. Right now,
meta-programming DNA remains a theory, but whether it’s proved true or
false via experiment obscures the main point — science many times
proclaims absolute fact based on a *lack* of understanding, not from
experimental evidence. Vestigial organs, junk DNA, and evolution itself
are theories based on *no* information. Remember, science is based on
experimental evidence. No experiment, no science.

In time we’ll find out the purpose for so-called junk DNA, and then
perhaps it won’t be labeled as God’s mistake, but we’ll be in awe of the
incredible design.
