Christians (and it’s good advice for everyone else) are called to be
skeptical—several places in the Bible it states check things out for
yourself and don’t believe something just because it came from an
“authoritative” source; many of those sources turn out to be false. Do
your homework, or as Jesus said “Take heed that no one deceive you”.

Of course, much deception comes from politics; many people accept
whatever “facts” become thrown out, failing to search and see if those
things be true. As Christians, you must not take such a position.
*Please* do your homework.

We’ll consider *one* such example here. How often have you heard
politicians speak of the surplus in the late 1990’s? It’s become
folklore, but only one problem with it—it’s totally false (well, not
exactly, it’s really a “truth-lie”).

In politics and elsewhere, an interesting phenomenon involves (as John
Loeffler calls it) the “truth-lie”—a statement which may (barely) be
*technically* true, but could be designed to deceive you. The myth of
the late 1990’s surplus provides a perfect example of the truth-lie. It
contains enough truth so no one can be accused of lying, but it has been
crafted to deceive you into believing something which isn’t.

As it turns out, during the years of the promoted “surplus”, the country
borrowed more money and went further into debt. How can that happen, you
may ask. That’s the paradox of the truth-lie—in this example, the
politicians promoted a surplus, but the full truth was anything but a
surplus existed.

Stay with us during this analysis, it’s *vital* for you to understand
how a truth-lie can be used to deceive you, and remember you’re called
to be a skeptic to prevent you from being deceived.

This article responds to comments made on an article concerning the
[increasing national debt]({% post_url 2010-04-19-increasing-federal-deficit %}).
If you read the comments you’ll notice someone denied the accuracy of
the data, and proclaimed instead of deficits the federal government
actually had surpluses. After all the discussion, he still denied the
data, and prompted this detailed analysis to prove the myth of the
surplus — it’s a truth-lie.

<p style="margin:0;">**This analysis contains many links and footnotes, so you might want to

Background
----------

<p><img id="image-feddeficit" src="/images/blog/201005-surplusmyth-fed-deficit.png" alt="image-FedDeficit" title="Federal Deficit" width="305" height="231" class="centered border"></p>

That simple graph from The Market Ticker
(http://market-ticker.denninger.net/) caused much confusion during
discussion of the increasing national debt,
and provides a perfect example of a truth-lie, and why the truth-lie
causes so much damage and confusion. Usually, if you dig deep enough,
the truth-lie can be exposed for what it is, and this one is
no exception.


> (September 2000) The estimated surplus of at least $230 billion [FY
> 2000] follows a surplus of $124 billion in FY 1999 and $69 billion
> in FY 1998.  
> <cite>http://clinton4.nara.gov/WH/new/html/Tue_Oct_3_113400_2000.html</cite>

The error raises such an important issue we’ll take some time to delve
into it fully, as not only the myth of the surplus continues to be told,
but it’s a good example of how groups manufacture a truth-lie. Stay with
us, it’s vital you understand not only the myth, but *how* a truth-lie
comes to life.

Truth-Lie Defined
-----------------

How can something be truth and lie at the same time? If you involve
yourself in politics at all, you’re quite familiar with it, even if you
don’t know the name. It’s the art of technically telling the truth, but
structuring it in a way which leaves people with a deliberately
misleading impression.

### Truth, whole truth, and nothing but the truth

Many people believe upon swearing in court before testimony “the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth” repeatedly states the same
principle. Not so, the statement has been carefully crafted; those parts
do not equate.

-   Truth—no lying.
-   The Whole Truth—Don’t omit or leave anything out.
-   Nothing but the Truth—No opinions or conclusions, let facts speak
    for themselves.

If you tell the truth, but ignore the other two parts of the oath, it’s
quite possible to be technically factual, but deliberately mislead
people into thinking something else. Of course, if that’s your goal (as
often occurs in political discussions), the truth-lie becomes a most
favored and revered strategy.

### Definition

> truth-lie (n) — A statement which might be technically true, but could
> create an impression of something else which might not be true. The
> political equivalent to the magician’s slight of hand, the truth-lie
> may be specially crafted for the specific purpose of creating a
> false impression.

For example, you’ll frequently hear during spending fights “the military
is the biggest non-discretionary part of federal spending”. Technically
true, but note the weasel words “non-discretionary”. Many people don’t
know what that is, so they hear “the military is the biggest part of
federal spending”, which *isn’t* true, although that false statement is
often repeated.

Thus, a truth-lie is born. Quite popular in politics.

What is the Deficit?
--------------------

We’ve got to define two terms: debt & deficit. Frequently interchanged,
they’re *not* the same thing, although similar and related to
each other.

-   Debt—total amount the federal government owes, similar to the
    balance on a credit card.
-   Deficit—the yearly amount the government spends above what it takes
    in, like spending on a credit card after you’ve spent your
    entire paycheck.

If you engage in deficit spending, the debt rises by the amount of
deficit spending. It’s that simple.

Myth of the Surplus
-------------------

OK, so now we’re armed with how a truth-lie springs to life, and what
the debt and deficit are. Let’s dig into some geeky financial data and
see how this specific truth-lie exists. Don’t worry, it won’t really be
that bad. Honest.

Did the surplus during those years ever exist? And if not, how did the
CBO make it seem like there was? Here’s the relevant part (page 1) from
the CBO report cited:

<div class='table-wrapper'>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
     <th>Year</th>
     <th>Public Debt</th>
   </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>1997</td><td>3.772</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1998</td><td>3.721</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1999</td><td>3.632</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2000</td><td>3.410</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2001</td><td>3.320</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2007</td><td>5.035</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

Lo and behold, notice the debt went *down* a few years; that’s how the
myth of the surplus came to be, and is the truth part of the truth-lie.
But that’s not the whole truth; the CBO exists as a political entity
(while supposedly non-partisan). Recalling back to 2007, *nobody*
claimed the US debt was only $5 Trillion, so the CBO report doesn’t
pass the sniff-test; the strange debt level should be a clue somebody’s
playing with incomplete information.

Where else can information on the United States national debt be found?
Consider the official keepers of the national debt, the US Treasury
department where you can obtain the official [United States debt to the
Penny](http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np).

From the official keepers of the United States Federal Government
National Debt, here’s what they reveal on the total national debt of the
United States (Note: Federal fiscal years run Oct-Sep, so the end of
September represents the end of the year. This causes confusion for
those thinking the end of the year arrives on December 31st).

<div class='table-wrapper'>

</div>

You’ll notice those numbers differ a bit, so let’s look at a graph
comparing those numbers; charts of numbers are b-o-r-i-n-g while a
picture is worth a thousand words.

<p><img src="/images/blog/201005-surplusmyth-debt-summary.png" alt="image-debt-summary" title="Debt Summary" width="312" height="190" class="centered border"></p>

Comparing those numbers, *immediately* a few things jump off the page
and scream “notice me!”.

1.  The debt numbers don’t match! Not even close—the problem isn’t
    simply a statistical problem or rounding error.
2.  CBO reports a surplus and a reduction in debt, while the Treasury
    reports a steady increase in debt. The trends differ.
3.  CBO reports considerably *less* debt than the official keepers of
    the national debt, the US Treasury.

Those items should immediately raise red flags on the data—and you must
ask yourself who, what, and why.

-   *Why* do those numbers differ?
-   *What* is missing in the CBO report, relative to the
    Treasury Department?
-   *Who* benefits from citing the CBO report?

As some people note (and many politicians like to say), the CBO reported
a “surplus” for a few years, and the country actually paid down the
debt! Yet something’s fishy—the US Treasury reports total debt
*increased* each year, which contradicts the CBO claims of surplus.
Who’s right? The CBO, politicians and the commenter? Or the Treasury?
*Both* those numbers can’t be right.

So what’s going on?

### How the Debt works

Looking at the detailed treasury data available, you’ll notice it’s
divided into two parts—public and Intragovernmental holdings; allow the
[Treasury Department](http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/resources/faq/faq_publicdebt.htm)
in their FAQ to describe exactly what those are.

> *What is the Debt Held by the Public?* The Debt Held by the Public is
> all federal debt held by individuals, corporations, state or local
> governments, foreign governments, and other entities outside the
> United States Government less Federal Financing Bank securities.
>
> *What are Intragovernmental Holdings?* Intragovernmental Holdings are
> Government Account Series securities held by Government trust funds,
> revolving funds, and special funds; and Federal Financing
> Bank securities.

Notice the words “Government trust funds”—does that ring a bell…like
Social Security? Ding ding ding! Winner! It’s money the government owes
*itself*, or perhaps phrasing it better would be obligation—it’s an
obligation of the Federal government and must be paid, exactly the same
as any other debt.

If you would like further detail, [Craig Steiner](http://www.craigsteiner.us/articles/30) has more information on
calculating the debt and explaining how it works.

### Surplus Shell Game: Creating a truth-lie

Now you understand the debt/deficit, and how the Treasury accounts for
the total debt. Armed with those facts, it should be easy to figure out
how the CBO played the surplus shell game.

Simply put, they borrowed from their left pocket (raiding Social
Security and other “trust” funds) and put it in their right (the general
fund), reporting only the money in the right pocket. Surprise! Instant
surplus. Of course, if you’ve studied Social Security, you know no
lockbox exists, nothing but IOU’s exists (one of the reasons we’re in
*big* trouble, but entitlement spending is a topic for another time).

Notice the weasel words on the CBO report “Debt held by the Public”,
which you’re now quite aware ignores a huge portion of the national
debt. Most people have no idea what the different parts of the debt are,
and certainly don’t ever look at the official US debt from the Treasury,
blindly believing what they’ve been told. That’s why this
truth-lie works.

Let’s put all we’ve found in one chart (the truth, *the whole truth*,
and nothing but the truth).

<div class='table-wrapper'>
<table>
  <thead><tr><th> </th><th colspan="3">Treasury Dept</th>
<th>CBO</th>
</tr><tr><th>Date</th>
<th>Pub Debt</th>
<th>IG Debt</th>
<th>Total</th>
<th>Pub Debt</th>

<tbody>
  <tr><td>1997</td><td>3.79</td><td>1.62</td><td>5.41</td><td>3.77</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1998</td><td>3.73</td><td>1.79</td><td>5.53</td><td>3.72</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1999</td><td>3.64</td><td>2.02</td><td>5.66</td><td>3.63</td></tr>
  <tr><td>2000</td><td>3.41</td><td>2.27</td><td>5.67</td><td>3.41</td></tr>

  <tr><td>2002</td><td>3.55</td><td>2.68</td><td>6.23</td><td>3.54</td></tr>
 </tbody>
</table>
</div>

The CBO only reports part of the picture—they don’t tell the whole
truth! They report public debt, but ignore Intragovernmental Holdings.
Notice the similarity of the Treasury and CBO’s Public Debt numbers, but
CBO completely ignores Intragovernmental Holdings, which means their
debt numbers are incomplete (and quite *less* than total debt).

But as can be clearly seen, the national debt *never* went down, thus,
by definition, the US government spent more than it received in
revenue—in other words deficit spending. The “surplus” mentioned over
and over never existed (and the debt was never “paid down”)—US debt
*increased* each year, when you take the complete picture and use all
the data.

It’s an attempt to deceive you, and based on how many people believe
such a surplus actually existed, it’s been a very effective truth-lie.

#### Washington’s Twilight Zone

How do they claim a surplus, while the truth is otherwise? It all
depends on what “is” is. Seriously. For example, a [budget defined](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/budget) as “An
estimation of the revenue and expenses over a specified future period of
time” can be compared to a report to see how well it matches
the definition.

A budget takes total income and total expenses for a period of time
(usually a fiscal year) and the difference yields either a surplus or
deficit. If you buy a latte for $5 and a Porche for $50,000, with a
yearly salary of $40,000, you’ve got a deficit of $10,005. Simple
really. But that’s not how Washington works.

They’ll pass on the latte, buy the Porche, and proclaim “we’ve saved
$5”, and in their “budget”, ignore the Porche (try that with your
accountant and see how far you get). Of course, the Treasury
Department—which must deal with *total* spending—borrows $50,000 and
adds it to the national debt.

Presto! Instant surplus. Of course, the promoted “surplus” comes from
*borrowed* money. For example, suppose a family wants to live above
their means and each month dips into their home equity line of credit.
Presto! More income, and more to buy cars and other items with. Then
they ignore the increasing mountain of debt and life is good!

Wait a minute, many people tried that exact strategy and it didn’t work
out too well, did it? The resulting mortgage foreclosure rates
demonstrate you can’t simply borrow and spend, while thinking it’s a
surplus of income. The Federal Government differs not a bit from that
example—sooner or later the bill comes due.

That’s the answer to why CBO and Treasury data differ, and how CBO
claims (in our mythical example) a savings (“surplus”) of $5, while the
Treasury Department actually borrows $50,000. It’s similar to a
magician’s slight-of-hand to get you looking in one direction, while
ignoring reality. The magician may perform his slight-of-hand directly
in front of you, but it’s easy to miss the deception.

#### Where the money came from

The money comes from Social Security and other trust funds, you know,
that “lock box” where your contributions are supposed to go? They spent
it. The social security debt and obligation still exist, but they took
the social security taxes (stole might be a better word) from one pile
(the social security trust fund), put it in another (the general year
fund), spent it, and left IOU’s in the social security fund. If you’re
upset after you notice they’ve been lying all along,
it’s understandable.

Did anyone know and understand this was occurring? Some did, but ask
yourself, have you heard much reporting about the following?

### Sausage-making and the CBO

Why would the CBO release such information? A clue comes from how they
work. If you think they take a proposed bill, carefully examine it and
report the financial results you’re quite naive. The trick Congress uses
to game the system remains quite simple: CBO scores whatever
they’re told.

Really, that’s the key. To understand that little scam, suppose I put
forth the following bill:

> SB 2345: The Cancer Medical Savings Act of 2010
>
> Whereas, cancer causes such hardship and financial disaster for many
> Americans, and it creates undue cost for the treatment thereof, be it
> resolved by this Congress cancer is hearby eliminated, beginning with
> fiscal year 2012.

What would CBO do? They’ll dutifully score the “savings” for this bill,
reporting back to Congressional leaders all the billions in “savings”
from our bill. Absurd? Of course.

CBO reports whatever the bill contains—if a bill says cancer disappears
in one year, they’ll score it. In other words, they don’t necessarily
score the *assumptions* of the bill, but only what effect those
assumptions will have. (Sometimes in the report you might see a warning
about assumptions, but that’s about it as everyone focuses on the
alleged “savings”, not the warnings).

Then Senators get up on the Senate floor and proclaim “SB 2345 has
billions in savings, says the CBO. We need to pass this now!”, all the
while knowing it’s a stinking festering pile of poo. Yep, it can be
that dishonest.

While they’re supposed to be non-partisan, they certainly are political,
and quite easy to game to get whatever results you want.

Truth-Lie
---------

In short, the CBO report doesn’t pass muster (it doesn’t even add up as
the appendix proves, a not-so-subtle clue it excludes items), as they
didn’t tell the whole truth. It’s a truth-lie. And now you know, as Paul
Harvey would say … the rest of the story.

### Objections

Various people for their own reasons attempt to justify the CBO data,
but those discussions aren’t worth much consideration, as one fact
exists they can’t escape—if a surplus existed, why did the government
borrow more money during years of alleged “surplus”, increasing the
total debt? Nevertheless, let’s consider a few of those objections, and
notice how quickly they can be dismissed as incorrect.

*The variances between CBO and Treasury are just statistical noise.* Not
true. Examine the chart and notice the Public Debt numbers for the CBO
and the Treasury are quite close, but the CBO doesn’t report the IG
debt, thus their reporting of debt equals only about half total US debt.
Since they don’t include all the data, the conclusion won’t be
accurate either.

*The IG Debt doesn’t count, and that’s why CBO doesn’t use it.* Tell
that to all the recipients of Social Security who count on those trust
funds. Yes, it really does count as part of the debt, as any reporting
of the US debt will include (currently about $13 Trillion and rising).

*The total debt includes “off-budget” items CBO doesn’t use.* Imagine
telling your accountant you took out a home equity loan, used it to buy
a new car, so your net worth went up … as long as you ignore the new
loan. That’s quite absurd. Obviously to get a complete picture, complete
data must be used. No Enron-style rules allowed (if you want a
complete picture).

*But
[Factcheck.org](http://www.factcheck.org/askfactcheck/during_the_clinton_administration_was_the_federal.html)
says even if you remove Social Security, the surplus still existed.*
That’s another truth-lie of it’s own. Yes, that *may* be true (we didn’t
fact-check their numbers) but other trust funds exist besides Social
Security. To dig into that, the Treasury Department issues Monthly
Treasury Statement (MTS) detailing financial transactions, and you can
examine the [September 2000 report](http://fms.treas.gov/mts/mts0900.pdf) showing Social Security
trust funds of $152.3 Billion, while total funds equal $246.5 Billion.
That’s about $100 Billion missing from the factcheck.org analysis
(maybe we need fact-checkers for factcheck.org. Hat Tip for the
FactCheck analysis: [Craig Steiner](http://www.craigsteiner.us/articles/30)).

Bottom line: CBO doesn’t include all the debt in their report. Period.
The Treasury does. Thus it’s no surprise those two methods don’t yield
the same result—different inputs, different outputs. Of course, if you
want a total picture of how much the country owes, common sense says
you’d better use *all* the data.

Deficit-Deniers
---------------

By using a small amount of critical thinking, it’s obvious the CBO
numbers don’t include the entire picture, and thus don’t result in a
complete picture of the debt/deficit.

In the end, those still clinging to the myth of the surplus (shall we
call them deficit-deniers?) simply haven’t done their homework. Yes,
it’s tedious and boring, but a through analysis demonstrates the surplus
never existed, and your children will have to pay for all the deficit
spending … even during “surplus” years.

First thing to notice, the total debt in the last column isn’t the same
as the total national debt recorded by the Treasury department—the guys
who actually handle the debt. This alone reveals hidden items in the CBO
report, or items excluded in the totals presented. Notice the last
column “public debt” — where are the Intragovernmental Holdings? They
fail to include it, thus their national debt is wrong, and thus so are
their conclusions about the claimed surplus (which never existed).

But that’s not the only problem with the report—it simply doesn’t add
up. Notice the “surplus” in 2000 equaled $236.2 Billion. That means the
debt went down by $236.2 billion, right? Well, not exactly (remember,
this *is* Washington math). In 1999 the debt was $3,632.4 Billion, and
in 2000 after the “surplus” of $236.2 Billion the debt totaled
$3,409.8 Billion. Notice anything fishy? Try this math: 3,632.4 -
3,409.8 = 222.6. Hmmm … A “surplus” of $236.2 Billion reduces the
deficit not by $236.2 Billion, but $222.6 Billion. Tilt! Where’s the
missing $13.6 Billion? The CBO numbers don’t add up. That *alone*
should be a not-so-subtle clue of a strange issue, something you need to
dig in to deeper.

### Spending Social Security

Let’s analyze the 2000 numbers. Notice the “on-budget” surplus claim of
$86.4 Billion, with total surplus of $236.2 Billion. But notice they
*included* Social Security of $151.8 Billion! Wait a minute, those are
supposed to be trust funds, and already guaranteed to the recipients of
Social Security. In other words, they counted that money twice!

Additionally, as we saw earlier in the MTS (Table 6 Schedule D
Investments of Federal Government Accounts in Federal Securities,
September 2000 and Other Periods. <http://fms.treas.gov/mts/mts0900.pdf>
page 24-25), Social Security isn’t the only trust fund. According to
that report, Social Security in 2000 had $152.3 Billion in funds (CBO
reported $151.8 Billion), but that wasn’t the only trust fund.

Looking at pages 24-25 of the September 2000 MTS, notice the grand total
of funds—$246.5 Billion dollars, or about $94.2 Billion *more* than
what appears on the CBO report. Thus, the alleged surplus of $236.2
Billion, subtract Social Security of $151.8 Billion (adjust for Postal
Service as well), and you arrive at the on-budget number of $86.4
Billion in the CBO report.

But from the MTS, we know that’s not *all* the trust funds, so we also
have to subtract $94.2 Billion (which doesn’t appear in the report)
from the $86.4 Billion to arrive at a deficit of $7.8 Billion for the
year 2000, all the while politicians (and others) promoted the truth-lie
of a $236.2 Billion “surplus”.

Thus, according to the CBO report, *and including all available data*,
we arrive at a 2000 deficit of $7.8 Billion, instead of the claimed
“surplus” of $236.2 Billion. So how much did the Treasury actually
borrow that year? From the Treasury “Debt to the Penny”, 9/29/1999 the
debt equaled $5.656 Trillion, and on 9/29/2000 the debt equaled $5.674
Trillion, and on 9/28/2001 th debt equaled $5.807 Trillion. Those equal
*deficits* of $18 Billion and $133 Billion respectively (and match the
chart which the commenter objected to), instead of surpluses.

That’s how the country went further in debt during years of alleged
“surplus”. By now you can see by scrutinizing the reports and using all
the data from Federal sources the CBO doesn’t include all financial data
in their report, thus the result won’t provide a complete
picture either.

Notice also in the CBO report, they state openly they *spent the Social
Security trust fund*. That should cure the myth of the Social Security
trust fund “lock-box”, but entitlements are a subject for a later time.

### CBO Reporting

It’s not just that year, the 1999 surplus was $125.6 Billion, but the
reduction in debt was 3,721.1 - 3,632.4 = 88.7, or a difference of
$36.9 Billion less in debt reduction than the alleged surplus
would indicate.

In short, some people might try to explain why the CBO report doesn’t
add up, but simply note the CBO data is internally inconsistent—in other
words, it doesn’t add up (quite literally). *Billions* of dollars escape
reporting; what kind of accounting system ignores major portions
of debt?

Oh yeah, Washington style, where deficits can be reported as surplus and
everyone believes it—with “surpluses” like these, the country will be
bankrupt soon as Federal debt continues to rise.
