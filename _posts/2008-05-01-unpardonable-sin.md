Satan wants to cause FUD (a TLA [three letter acronym] known in the
computer industry — standing for Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt) among
God’s people. For example, when the Israelites left Egypt and traveled
towards the promised land, just before they were to enter in they sent
in twelve spies to search out the land. Ten returned with bad news —
there were giants in the land, and we are no match for them. Two of them
said God is with us, it’s no problem, let’s go in and take it. But
Israel succumbed to satan’s old trick, FUD. Therefore, they wandered for
40 years, and their children were the ones to enter into the land.

This has important implications for today’s Christian. For what does the
promised land represent? If you say heaven, you’re not quite right —
there are giants to defeat, and many battles. No, the promised land
represents the spirit filled life; some battles still remain.

Don’t we all want to have a spirit filled life? Then we must be able to
resist the FUD of the enemy. Satan uses FUD to keep us wandering in the
wilderness, unfocused and powerless to engage the enemy; satan is still
up to his old FUD tricks today.

> Wherefore I say unto you, all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be
> forgiven men; but the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit shall not be
> forgiven unto men. And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of
> man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever speaketh against the Holy
> Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this age, neither in
> the age to come. (Matthew 12:31-32 KJV)

This causes concern for some Christians as they ask — have I done this?
What if I’ve done it and not even known it? What if I did it before I
became a Christian? Jesus says it is not pardonable. Does that mean I’m
lost forever?

We must find out exactly what the unpardonable sin is as Jesus says all
sin, except this one, is forgivable. In other words, only one way exists
to end up in hell. How exactly does that happen? By the rejection of
Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior. It’s just that simple. If you want
to go to hell, that’s the way to do it. So this must have something to
do with the rejection of Jesus.

But Jesus says it’s blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, not against Him.
But what is the Holy Spirit’s job? To point the way to Jesus. To convict
us of sin (John 16:8-9). To show a need for a savior. Before you are a
Christian, the Holy Spirit is the one who constantly whispers in your
ear “you need to come to Jesus”. The Holy Spirit never speaks of
Himself, His job is to speak about Jesus (John 16:14).

Of course, you can choose to reject His prompting if you wish. He still
whispers in your ear, trying to draw you to Jesus. But if someone
continues to reject Jesus, eventually their heart becomes so hard the
Holy Spirit stops speaking to them. At that point, the person has
committed the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit and is eternally lost. It’s
not that they won’t come to Jesus, they *can’t*. Without the Spirit’s
work in a person, salvation is impossible; when the Spirit gives up,
salvation is no longer possible as by ourselves we will never seek God
(Romans 3:10-12).

But at this point it’s easy to think about our family and friends,
wondering, have they done this? Are they eternally lost? And it’s
crucial to remember there is no way for us to know if someone has gone
too far and committed the unpardonable sin, so we must never cease
praying and trying to nudge someone to Jesus. Just because someone looks
like they have forever rejected Jesus, doesn’t mean they have as some of
the most unlikely people have become Christians. Former drug dealers,
hippies, murderers, and others have all turned from their corrupt ways.
We must never give up on anyone; God may have mighty plans for them.

As a Christian, do you fear you have committed the unpardonable sin?
Hopefully by now it is obvious you can’t do it as a Christian. The
reason is simple — once you accept Jesus, that part of the Holy Spirit’s
job is complete, thus you can’t blaspheme His work. Naturally, He
continues to work with you, and you can be stubborn and resist Him as a
Christian, but you can’t blaspheme Him. Live unproductively, carnal and
unspiritual, possible. But commit the unpardonable sin? It’s just not
possible for a true Christian. Remember what Paul said:

> There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ
> Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. (Romans 8:1 KJV)

And perhaps stated much more simply than all the previous analysis is
the commentary given by Chuck Missler during his Matthew series. He
boiled everything down to one simple line:

> If you are worried about having committed the unpardonable sin, you
> haven’t done it![1]

The very fact you are worried about it proves you are seeking God, and
that means the Holy Spirit is working in your life, which means He
hasn’t given up on you, which means you have not committed the
unpardonable sin, which means salvation is still possible.

But we must be careful not to commit a subtle logical error. If we have
an if-then statement, subtle errors in logic can creep in. For example,
consider the following statement: If the sun comes up tomorrow, I will
go to work. We can make several additional logical statements based on
the original:

-   Inverse (negate both sides): If the sun doesn’t come up tomorrow, I
    won’t go to work.
-   Converse (reverse order of statements): If I go to work tomorrow,
    the sun came up.
-   Contrapositive (negate and reverse order of statements): If I don’t
    go to work tomorrow, the sun didn’t come up.

The question is, if we accept our original statement as true, are these
others true? Or can they be either true or false? Let’s look at each
one. The inverse is not (necessarily) true. I could use headlights and
drive in the dark, and it’s not a contradiction of our original
statement (since if it’s dark, I don’t know if I go to work or not — the
original statement only gives information if the sun comes up, if it
doesn’t our original statement does not reveal any information). The
converse is not true for the same reason; I could drive in the dark.

However, the contrapositive *is* true. It’s the only additional logical
statement we can make and be sure it is true. Many times someone takes
the inverse or converse and assumes it’s true — it might be, but we
don’t know it is. These errors in logic are extremely common in
advertising, and in any other area where the goal is deception, since
most people don’t recognize these errors.

If we say “if you are worried, you haven’t done it”, we can’t say “if
you aren’t worried, you have (or could have) done it”. In other words,
if you have a friend who doesn’t seem to care, don’t attempt to draw any
conclusion about their status with the unpardonable sin.

The unpardonable sin causes great FUD among Christians, but only if we
allow satan to twist the words of Jesus into something He never
intended. By becoming more familiar with the Word of God, we can use our
sword to defend us when the enemy attempts to throw FUD our way.
