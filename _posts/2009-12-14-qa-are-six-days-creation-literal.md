A debate rages regarding the meaning of “day” in Genesis. Some argue the
day means what we understand it to be — a period of 24 hours — while
others argue the Hebrew can mean “age”, thus the creation could have
taken billions of years; some people attempt to reconcile the Bible with
evolution (a situation which leaves both sides wanting. It’s just not
possible to reconcile evolution with the Bible. We’ve written lots on
evolution, search the site to find it).

But regarding the creation in Genesis, is it possible to know if it was
a 24 hour period or billions of years? The answer won’t be found in
Genesis, but in Exodus, as the 10 commandments are given:

> But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou
> shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy
> manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that
> is within thy gates. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth,
> the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day;
> wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. (Exodus
> 20:10–11 KJV)

The context speaks of the Sabbath, and then refers to the creation by
God. The context in Exodus makes the meaning clear — creation occurred
in six days, with day being the common meaning we understand.
