Bible translations come and go; we generally don’t proclaim all modern
translations evil as it’s not inherently bad to have a Bible in modern
English, but you *must* be careful — some of these groups claim they’re
only updating English and grammar, but after a careful review you find
they don’t just update English, but actually change doctrines to fit
their liberal theology — all under the guise of “updating” the
venerable KJV.

Don’t be fooled — what God wrote, He wrote. Nobody has to believe it,
like it, or accept it, but to claim God didn’t want His Word to apply
today strikes us as the height of hubris. Once you go down that road,
who gets to decide what parts fit today and what doesn’t? What doctrine
still applies today, and what doesn’t? And by what methods do you pick
and choose? Oh yes, the “we’ll use the best of modern scholarship” rears
its ugly head again. But we’ll take God’s word over modern scholarship,
and we’d recommend everyone do the same.

In the end “scholars” end up with a designer religion bearing little
resemblance to Christianity — how many “scholars” and pastors deny the
virgin birth, existence of hell, literal return of Jesus, and the
inerrancy of the Bible? How much picking and choosing of what they feel
to apply for today, and what they won’t? They may use orthodox
terminology, but only to cover their un-Christian ideas straight from
the pit of hell.

Instead of Christianity, they’ve built themselves a cult of liberal
theology. That’s fine if they so choose to and reject Christianity, but
keep your slimy “scholarship” off my Bible.

The latest to get the “updating” treatment is the NIV. We’re not big
fans of the NIV generally, but it does have uses. But we’re definitely
wary of any update when “scholars” complain the new 2011 version of the
NIV won’t be liberal enough! Notice what Bart Ehrman (a self-described
“renowned Bible scholar”) has to say about it.

<blockquote cite="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/la-na-gender-bible6-2009sep06,0,5733972.story">
<p>Reporting from Chicago —  When the new New International Version of the Bible is unveiled in 2011, don’t look for androgynous vocabulary that had rankled some evangelicals. In fact, as soon as the latest version is published, the gender-neutral Today’s New International Version will&nbsp;vanish.</p>
<p>“If we want to maintain the NIV as a Bible that English speakers around the world can understand, we have to listen to and respect the vocabulary they are using today,” said Keith Danby, president of&nbsp;Biblica.</p>
<p>New Testament scholar and author Bart Ehrman doubts the revision has as much to do with the evolution of the English language as the orthodox trends in evangelical&nbsp;thought.</p>
<p>“They are changing the gender-neutral language, no doubt, because their ‘base’ is conservative evangelical Christians who are offended by anything that appears to have a feminist agenda behind it, not because the language has changed,” Ehrman said. “If it has changed, of course, it has changed toward greater gender neutrality — except in religiously and politically conservative&nbsp;circles.”</p>

We’ve noted about Mr. [Ehrman’s total lack of credible scholarship]( {% post_url 2009-05-15-pseudo-scholarship-why-do-people-suffer %})
before — so much so even [atheists heap scorn on his bizarre]({% post_url 2009-06-18-pseudo-scholarship-even-atheists-dismiss %})
theories. But let’s look at *one* example of the TNIV (1 Corinthians
15:21), and you’ll quickly see why it’s corrupt, and why these attempts
to “modernize” the Bible frequently also turn out corrupt, no matter how
many “scholars” work on them (even if they call themselves “renowned”)
using the “best of modern scholarship”.

Death came from Adam (we’ll say he was a man, but perhaps the “scholars”
disagree), and the Resurrection comes from Jesus, who was also a man
(again, scholars?). In this case they go *way* beyond gender language,
changing the intent and meaning of a passage — all in the name of
“scholarship” and “gender-neutral”. Why were these “gender-neutral”
changes made when it’s obvious the passages mean Adam (man) and Jesus
(man)? If they’re going to eliminate gender, why not just call Jesus
“it”? Of course, Paul had something to say about mixing gender roles in
1 Corinthians 11, but perhaps they’ll leave out that chapter — it likely
doesn’t fit with their worldview anyway.

Hands off my Bible — don’t let any “scholar” tell you some parts don’t
apply, or the Bible needs to be “updated” for modern times. Hogwash.

You’re free to accept or reject the Bible as you wish, but it’s quite
the example of hubris to re-write it to fit your own mold — and that
hubris frequently comes from so-called “scholars”.

As Bible versions appear and disappear with regularity you’re left with
problems — especially if you want to memorize. What will you do with all
your memorized NIV verses when they no longer match the 2011 NIV? Worse,
they’ll likely stop selling the older version, so even if you want to
you’ll have no way to purchase what you’re familiar with; another hidden
danger of the modern versions as they come and go.

Good riddance TNIV. Will the 2011 NIV be as bad? We hope not, but most
likely it will be between what the NIV is now, and what the liberal
scholars hoped for in the TNIV.

God doesn’t change, why do scholars want to change His Word?
