> There are lies, dammed lies, and statistics. (Mark Twain)

I’m reminded of a story about newspaper reporting in the old Soviet
Union (I don’t know if it’s true or not, but it illustrates a point
well). A car race between the United States and the Soviets ended with the
United States car in first, and the Soviet car second (you should also know
only  two cars were in this race). But the reporting in the Soviet Union
stated the Soviet car came in second, while the United States car came in
second to last. Perfectly true, and yet perfectly misleading.

You must be careful with statistics. For example, it’s
*possible* the air in your room right now could
spontaneously all move in the same direction at once, piling up in the
other side of the room leaving you gasping for air. Possible, yes. But
when calculated, the probability is so small as to be reasonably rounded off
to zero (it’s not going to happen, so breathe easy).

A similar argument against evolution applies to the probability of
events occurring which result in new species (mutations, natural
selection  and spontaneous generation). That probability is zero (when rounded
off reasonably). It’s mathematically *possible*, but the
expectation is so low we logically round it down to zero and state the
event is never going to occur.

So the evolutionist has a problem — the odds of evolution
occurring are zero. One tactic evolutionists attempt to show the
theory isn’t ridiculous (i.e. mathematically impossible) is showing highly
improbable events happen all the time — unfortunately, it’s usually
through a misapplication of statistics. You see, simple logic and
common sense tell you if (as they claim) improbable events happen frequently
one  of two situations is most likely true.

1.  The event really isn’t that improbable. Thus, our mathematical
    calculation of statistical odds is incorrect — an error in math has
    been made.
2.  Statistics have been misused or misunderstood, similar to our car
    race example. The facts and math are correct, but the application of
    that knowledge is wrong.

Common sense explains the argument is already wrong, but we can
continue with a specific example and explain exactly *why*
it’s wrong. One of the methods the evolutionist uses draws false
conclusions from a deck of cards — a mistake even a college professor
can make; consider the following discussion from a professor of
mathematics at Temple university.

<blockquote cite="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=2384584" title='ABC News'>
<p>So if, after the fact, we observe the particular
  evolutionary path actually taken and then calculate the a priori
  probability of its being taken, we will get the minuscule probability that
  creationists mistakenly attach to the process as a whole.
  Here’s another example. We have a deck of cards before us. There are
  almost 10 to the 68<sup>th</sup> power – a one with 68 zeroes after it – orderings
  of the 52 cards in the deck. Any of the 52 cards might be first, any of the
  remaining 51 second, any of the remaining 50 third, and so on. This is a
  humongous number, but it’s not hard to devise even everyday situations that
  give rise to much larger&nbsp;numbers.</p>
<p>Now if we shuffle this deck of cards for a long time and then
  examine the particular ordering of the cards that happens to result, we
  would be justified in concluding that the probability of this particular
  ordering of the cards having occurred is approximately 1 chance in 10 to
  the 68th power. This certainly qualifies as minuscule.
  Still, we would not be justified in concluding that the shuffles
  could not have possibly resulted in this particular ordering because its a
  priori probability is so very tiny. <em>Some ordering had to result from the
  shuffling, and this one did</em>. (What’s wrong with Creationist Probability
  — Mathematics Professor John Allen Paulos of Temple&nbsp;University)</p>
</blockquote>

Mr. Paulos gets his math right, but the
statistics wrong. The card example comes up repeatedly in attempts to
show evolution isn’t mathematically impossible, but this is the first time
I’ve actually seen a professor of math make the mistake.

His problem lies in the card example. Suppose I have a deck of
cards. He is correct in the 10<sup>68</sup> combinations of cards (the
probability of any 1 combination occurring). But he makes the mistake
of applying statistics. Actually, by shuffling and dealing the cards the
probability is 1 — it’s a certainty *one* sequence
will occur (one of the 10<sup>68</sup> possibilities). Mr. Paulos does
understand this, as he says “Some ordering had to result from
the shuffling”.

The one in 10<sup>68</sup> is the probability of calling out each
card — in order — as you turn them up. That’s the correct analogy
between  cards and evolution. It’s a certainty you will get *a*
sequence. But is it the exact sequence you want? Correct math, wrong
application. The probability is 1 you will get a sequence, but much
less likely you could correctly call out each card as it’s dealt (This is
also sometimes illustrated as a group of monkeys randomly typing out the
works of Shakespeare).

The card example illustrates a common mistake in the application of
statistics, and statistical mistakes can be difficult to uncover. As
already noted, if such improbable events really do happen commonly,
they’re not so improbable, are they (by definition)? But since the odds
calculation *is* correct (it’s not an error in math), it must be the
*application* of knowledge.

Let’s turn to Physicist Richard Feynman to explain the faulty
reasoning and the professor’s error immediately becomes obvious. For
those who might not know, Feynman was a Nobel-prize winning physicist
involved in The Manhattan Project, and on the panel investigating the space
shuttle Challenger disaster. But perhaps best known for a series of
undergraduate lectures captured in the famous “Feynman lectures on Physics”, Feynman
had the ability to illustrate complex problems simply.

Feynman makes Professor Paulos’ mistake
with the cards clear — it’s not an error in *math*,
it’s an error in *science*. The issue with cards relating to
evolution isn’t that any given sequence is wildly improbable, yet a
sequence comes up — when dealing cards it’s a
statistical certainty *a* sequence will occur (probability
one). The correct example relating to evolution would be to predict
each card as it is dealt (probability zero).

Physicist Feynman illustrates the difficulty when applying
mathematical statistics to science. It’s quite easy to make a mistake,
even for a professor of mathematics; Feynman illustrates the error through
his license plate example. Don’t be misled by lengthly, complicated
examples — anyone truly understanding a subject should be able to
explain it simply, as Feynman did. Sometimes (though certainly not
always), the complicated explanation simply provides a way to mask the
uncertainty involved (In Physics we called that “hand-waving” — the idea being to
distract from a lack of substance).

Predicting a sequence of cards as it is dealt is
impossible and correctly displays the improbability of evolution. The
probability of evolution occurring rounds down to zero — it’s not
going to happen.
