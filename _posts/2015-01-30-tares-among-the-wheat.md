I've received complaints when calling out heresies like 
[social justice]({% post_url 2010-08-02-social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel %})
— that of replacing the gospel with alternatives, a strange idea since
Paul explicitly defined the Gospel.

Just because someone calls themselves a Christian means nothing. How
much can you deny of Christianity before it's no longer Christian? In
other words, what *are* the foundations of Christianity?

It may shock you to discover so-called pastors who [deny the existence of God]({% post_url 2012-11-02-the-bizarreness-of-the-big-tent %}).

Yes, a coming church split will soon be upon us, between those holding
traditional Christianity, and those accepting everything and anything,
and thus nothing.

One popular buzzword is “progressive” Christianity. What do they
believe, and is it Christian?

<blockquote cite='http://progressivechristianity.org/resources/youre-not-a-real-progressive-christian/'>
<p>For example,  I don’t personally subscribe to the likelihood of a physical resurrection, or uniquely divine incarnation of Jesus, or that “Yahweh” is God.</p>
</blockquote>

Can this be related at all to Christianity? Not even close. No physical
resurrection? Then Jesus is a liar.

> Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself; handle me, and see;
> for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. (Luke 24:39 KJV)

Flesh and bones sounds pretty physical to me.

Yes, Jesus was physically resurrected, unless He lied. Denying it means
the Bible is in error and contains mistakes. Worse yet, it actively
attempts to deceive you, since it claims to be error free, and yet
contains false statements.

> All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for
> doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
> righteousness. (2 Timothy 3:16 KJV)

False statements, lies, and deception isn’t profitable, so if liberals
are to be believed Paul was wrong when writing to Timothy.

Are the liberals right, or the apostle Paul?

That is *exactly* what progressives argue for — the Bible contains
errors and myths, and we must de-mythologize it. Of course, you’re left
with several questions progressives never answer.

-   *Who* gets to decide what is and isn’t God’s Word?
-   *What* method will they use?
-   *Why* is their method superior to anyone elses?

You’ll never get answers to those questions. Liberals don’t want to talk
about it, because ultimately the answer is simple: Liberals simply don’t
want to believe the Bible is the Word of God.

In the end liberal theology is more about living the way people want to,
in [open rebellion against God]({% post_url 2011-10-14-tactics-rebellion %}), as
Walter Martin called it [the cult of liberal theology]({% post_url 2012-06-08-the-cult-of-liberal-theology %})
(you can get the message from his web site).

If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything as
[post-modern philosophy]({% post_url 2011-11-18-post-modern-philosophy-church %})
infests the church, denying truth exists.

> So while some advocate for a “big tent,” I advocate for a “HUGE tent.”

Again, they’ve forgotten (or ignored) the words of Jesus:

> Enter ye in at the strait gate; for wide is the gate, and broad is the
> way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in
> therein. Because straight is the gate, and narrow is the way, which
> leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. (Matthew 7:13–14 KJV)

If you're entering a big tent through a wide gate with many people in
it, according to Jesus you're in the wrong tent.

In the next verse, Jesus warns false prophets *will* be in the church.
Remember the tares and the wheat? Imposters are (almost) impossible to
detect.

Progressive “Christianity” theology is a tare among the wheat.

How do you know? Inspect the fruit — does the doctrine try to move you
away from the Gospel? Does it tell you the Bible isn’t really God’s
Word?

Ultimately deception will become so bad if possible even the elect will
buy it. Who won’t? Anyone knowing the Word of God. Those can spot the
imposter.

No doubt can exist liberal and progressive doctrine conflicts with the
Bible. Thus, you must choose — is liberal theology right, or is the
Bible?
 
They can't both be.

Will you follow mans wisdom or God’s? It's your choice. But you can’t
follow both, it’s one or the other.

I know this isn’t popular to say. I'm not on best seller lists. So be
it. I'll continue to be the watchman on the wall (Ezekiel 3 and 33), and
if you fail to heed the warning it’s your problem, not mine.
