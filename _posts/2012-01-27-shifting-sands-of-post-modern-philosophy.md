Post-modern philosophy may be the latest fad in “Christian” circles
(emerging-this, post-that, beyond-whatever, neo-something, social
justice, etc.), but when an author complains about what he calls
“neo-fundamentalism”, he actually reveals *why* post-modern philosophy
fails so spectacularly (although he probably didn’t mean to).

<blockquote cite="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/rogereolson/2012/01/neo-fundamentalism-excellent-but-somewhat-lengthy-essay/">
<p>The driving force behind neo-fundamentalism, as with historic fundamentalism, is a “remnant mentality.” Neo-fundamentalists believe they alone are remaining true to the fullness of the gospel and orthodox faith while the rest of the evangelical church is in grave, near-apocalyptic danger of theological drift, moral laxity, and compromise with a postmodern culture – a culture which they see as being characterized by a skepticism towards Enlightenment conceptions of “absolute truth,” a pluralistic blending of diverse beliefs, values, and cultures, and a suspicion of hierarchies and traditional sources of authority.</p>

Let’s define post-modernism:

> … it holds realities to be plural and relative, and to be dependent on
> whom the interested parties are and of what their interests consist.
> It supports the belief that there is no absolute truth and that the
> way in which different people perceive the world is subjective.

In general, emerging church, post-modern,social justice,
red-letter Christianity, liberal, and progressive groups all share some
characteristics of post-modern philosophy — mainly the denial of
absolute truth, and the desire to redefine terms and ideas from what the
Bible said, or change theology to fit culture.

That is, of course, a dangerous idea. Once you start changing the Bible,
*who* gets to decide what anything means, *how* do they do it, and
*what* gives them the authority to do so? Changing the Bible to fit
culture is *never* a good idea.

Post-modern philosophy at its core denies absolute truth. Thus the Bible
becomes … well … *whatever you want it to be*. Want to cheat on your
wife? Sure, post-modernize those passages — they were just for another
time you know (like qualifications for elders, church leadership roles,
definitions of sin and the Gospel, and so on).

Alcoholism? Post-modernize away! Don’t like God’s definition of sin?
Hey, let’s change it to fit with modern culture. Post-modernism to the
rescue! Using their own post-modern philosophy it’s quick and easy to
prove Jesus was a Republican, not a Democrat.

Moreover, **it’s impossible to prove otherwise**, as long as you’re
using relativistic post-modern philosophy. Jesus was a Bush-loving,
tax-cutting, small-government Republican who dislikes Clinton, Obama,
welfare, taxes, and Democrats. Don’t bother trying to show otherwise, as
you can’t (as long as we use post-modern philosophy and its shifting
definitions and “cultural norms”).

Ultimately, post-modern “Christianity” ends up in the same place as
atheism — morality, God, and religion becomes whatever *man* wants it to
be, and *never* defined by God (Richard Dawkins says “Moral philosophic
reasoning and a shifting zeitgeist”) as the poison of liberal theology
moves towards atheism.

Atheists and post-modernists end up in the same boat together — no absolute truth
exists, and truth becomes whatever society wants it to be. Richard Dawkins says
he doesn’t *want* absolutes, lining up perfectly with “Christians” who
change the Bible to suit them.

Wait a minute, you say, you can’t just change the Bible because you want
to be a drunk. Exactly. So why do some believe they can change what God
said about other things — like qualifications for elders, church
leadership, and more?

Post-modern “Christians” (yes we use the term *very* loosely) find
themselves in the same paradox as Dawkins — whether they realize it or
not (or admit it), because in spite of their denials, absolute truth
(Biblical or otherwise) exists and is knowable …

… Absolutely.
