We’ve first need to define terms — what defines an agnostic, and what
defines an atheist?

From Websters New World College Dictionary, Fourth Edition 2007:

> -   athe-ist (n.) A person who believes that there is no God.
> -   ag-nos-tic (n.) A person who believes that the human mind cannot
>     know whether there is a God or an ultimate cause, or anything
>     beyond material phenomena.
>
> An atheist rejects religious belief and denies the existence of God;
> an agnostic questions the existence of God, heaven, etc in the absence
> of material proof and an unwillingness to accept
> supernatural revelation.

Other dictionaries express similar definitions — “One who believes that
there is no deity” (Merriam-Webster), “One who disbelieves or denies the
existence of God or gods.” (American Heritage) and “a person who denies
or disbelieves the existence of a supreme being or beings.”
(Random House).
