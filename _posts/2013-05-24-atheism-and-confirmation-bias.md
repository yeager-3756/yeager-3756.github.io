A reader sent me an article called 
[Belief and the Brain’s God Spot](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/belief-and-the-brains-god-spot-1641022.html),
which stated “belief in a higher power is an evolutionary asset that
helps human survival.” Stunning. A textbook example of [confirmation bias](http://www.sciencedaily.com/articles/c/confirmation_bias.htm) —
the logical error of seeing any data as proof of your cause.

In this case, the god-denier must *never* see anything but atheistic
evolution, and in fact the attempt at god-denial taints any results they
might otherwise legitimately discover.

Let’s look at a few quotes.

> A belief in God is deeply embedded in the human brain, which is
> programmed for religious experience.

Isn’t that what the Bible says? God created man. In other words,
assuming the statement (if true) somehow relates to evolution is a
logical error and displays a lack of critical thinking skills. Simply
put, it’s bias.

> Religious belief and behaviour are a hallmark of human life, with no
> accepted animal equivalent, and found in all cultures,

Again, just like Genesis. Man is different from the animals.

So far, a few generic statements which could apply to many different
origins. However, the article continues to crash in flames, as it jumps
to the conclusion those traits are due to evolution.

> Some evolutionary theorists have suggested that Darwinian natural
> selection may have put a premium on individuals if they were able to
> use religious belief to survive hardships that may have overwhelmed
> those with no religious convictions.

Now they’re in la-la land. They've *assumed* (without proof) Darwinian
evolution, and that bias prejudices their conclusions.

Simply put, the study isn’t useful for making the conclusion they did —
Darwinian evolution — as the evidence also fits with the Bible (and
LGM’s, but we digress).

Start with a corrupted worldview, get corrupted results. Garbage in,
garbage out.

In contrast to the God-deniers, the Bible specifically tells you to
*avoid* their logical errors and lack of critical thinking.

> Prove all things; hold fast that which is good (1 Thessalonians 5:21)

Always be a skeptic and check things out for yourself. Evolution and
atheism are filled with logical errors — be
different and use logic the God-denier lacks.

Atheism begins with a lack of critical thinking, continues with logical
errors, and ends in absurdity. It may sound trendy at parties, but
atheism proudly proclaims its inability to think clearly.

As we’ve always recommended, if you want to travel down the path of
clear thinking, a good place to begin is Jason Lisle’s book [Discerning Truth](http://www.amazon.com/Discerning-Truth-Jason-Lisle/dp/0890515948/).
