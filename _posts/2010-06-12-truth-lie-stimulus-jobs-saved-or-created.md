Coming on the heals of debunking the 
[Myth of the Surplus]({% post_url 2010-06-01-truth-lie-myth-surplus %}),
deficit-deniers are back at it again with the sequel “Myth of the
Stimulus”, touting a [CBO report (May 26, 2010)](http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/115xx/doc11525/05-25-ARRA.pdf)
claiming millions of jobs created—but does the report have *any*
relevance to reality? We’ll quickly see it does not.

But first, the claim, as reported by ABC news.

And of course, political talking points were immediately seized by
Senate Democrats.

Anyone claiming the report has any basis in reality hasn’t read it. Of
course, not reading legislation and reports has become the official
pastime in Washington, but we digress.

You don’t need to look up the report, it actually claims “between 1.2
million and 2.8 million” jobs in first quarter of 2010 (the previous
Democratic quote inaccurately only reported the upper number). But just
like [Myth of the Surplus]({% post_url 2010-06-01-truth-lie-myth-surplus %}),
it’s not the numbers in the report, but *how* they obtained them. If you
recall, Myth of the Surplus explained how political operatives claimed a
surplus by citing CBO numbers, all while the national debt increased.

Those clinging to the absurd idea of the surplus (let’s call them
deficit-deniers) now cite another CBO report claiming a Trillion dollar
“Stimulus” created millions of jobs. The media and others gobbled this
myth up, but failed to verify the absurd claims or do any verifying
research at all. Just like the previous myth and deficit-deniers, the
stimulus-promoters haven’t done their homework as once again the CBO
report doesn’t pass the sniff-test, if you actually use some critical
thinking and analyze the report.

According to the CBO’s own director, the report isn’t worth the paper
it’s printed on—*if* you want an accurate picture of reality. If you
actually read the report, it admits it doesn’t rely on or use any *real*
data, but rather predictive models—the same models used to promote the
stimulus in the first place. Naturally, that makes the results worthless
to anyone with an IQ above single digits.

If you actually *read* the report, it includes the following disclaimer:

> …looking at recorded spending to date as well as estimates of the
> other effects of ARRA on spending and revenues, CBO has estimated the
> law’s impact on employment and economic output using evidence about
> the effects of previous similar policies on the economy and using
> various mathematical models that represent the workings of the economy.  
> <cite>http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/115xx/doc11525/05-25-ARRA.pdf (page 9 of PDF)</cite>

In other words, CBO didn’t perform actual counting or use any hard data,
rather it’s an estimate of what they believe *should* happen (based on
suspect [Keynesian Economics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian)),
not what actually *did* happen by counting actual job creation. In fact,
the report isn’t news itself—since it repeated the same analysis
promoting the stimulus in the first place, it would be news if the
report *didn’t* yield huge employment gains, since that’s what the
guesstimates originally said.

Anyone touting this report as proof of any actual job gains hasn’t read
it, or is attempting to deliberately deceive you. It’s that simple, as
the report itself (as well as the CBO director) admits they didn’t use
any actual real data.

Of course, if you prefer to live on [Fantasy Island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_Island) as Congress and the
Administration do, continue telling the [big lie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Lie) in hopes someone believes it
(and many will).

Do your own homework, and always ask what the assumptions and methods
are for any claim. In this case, CBO admits they’re not really
determining any jobs created by an analysis of actual data, but
repeating the earlier projections and assumptions of what the stimulus
*should* do, if everyone lived on Fantasy Island (and assuming
[Keynesian Economics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian) really
works, which is suspect).

This myth isn’t really a truth-lie, for it doesn’t contain *any* truth
at all; those blindly accepting it and believing mythical job creation
figures should say hello to Tattoo and Mr. Roarke for us as we prefer to
stay in reality and won’t be traveling with you to Fantasy Island.

After all, [Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four).
