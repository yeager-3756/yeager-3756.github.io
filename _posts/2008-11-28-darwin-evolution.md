It’s been said evolution is a fact, with just a few details left to work
out. But if you study science much, you recall another time when science
had the same amount of assurance — just at the first part of the 1900’s.
Physicists thought they had all the laws of physics explained, with just
a few details left to work out. But along came a guy by the name of
Einstein who shattered their comfort with a new branch of physics called
quantum mechanics. So much for the assurance of science — will the same
happen to evolution?

> Pride goes before destruction, And a haughty spirit before a fall.
> Better to be of a humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the
> spoil with the proud. (Proverbs 16:18-19 NKJV)

The following is only a *brief* summary of a few problems with the
current theory (some of which were raised by Darwin himself). Each by
itself could be the topic of a book — the goal here is to illustrate a
few things to think about in regards to evolution. Any person putting
their faith in the theory of evolution must have answers for these
questions. These are not just minor details to work out, they are
fundamental issues that *must* be resolved for the theory to
have credibility.

> When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, The moon and
> the stars, which You have ordained, What is man that You are mindful
> of him, And the son of man that You visit him? (Psalm 8:3-4 NKJV)

Part of that verse is simple. Man is composed of a few dollars worth of
chemicals. The first part, unfortunately, is considerably more difficult
to understand.

When we consider the heavens, we are left with two possible
explanations. Either Genesis is right, or Darwin was right. (The third,
that UFO’s have populated the earth, still leaves you with a choice
among the previous two). But which? Well, if Darwin was right, the
following statement has validity, and leads us to our first topic.

> If we place a group of monkeys in front of typewriters, given enough
> time, they would type out word for word the Encyclopedia Britannica.


## NATURAL SELECTION

Is the previous statement possible? Of course. However, this is *NOT*
the question to ask. The question to ask is, is it *probable?* In other
words, given the time the universe has been in existence, how likely is
it to occur? Evolution says as random mutations occur, those that are
beneficial to the species are more likely to be passed on to further
generations — “survival of the fittest”. As billions of years go by,
fish grow legs, legs change to wings, and goo turns to man.
Unfortunately, science has also found out this doesn’t work.

> If we place a group of monkeys in front of typewriters, given enough
> time, they would type out word for word the Encyclopedia Britannica.

If you actually calculate the odds of just the previous statement
occurring by chance, the odds of it occurring by monkeys typing is
impossible (impossible is defined as having a less than 1 in 10<sup>50</sup>
chance). So what do we do, since random mutations don’t work? Simple. We
say the mutations are not random. But how does “nature” determine what
goal to strive for?

Consider how a complex organ such as the eye evolves over millions of
years. Let’s assume some mutations have sensitized an area of the skin
to light, so that certain areas are more sensitive to light. What good
is this? By the theory, this has no benefit to the species so would be
selected out. But let’s suppose it survives, and goes on to develop into
an eye, complete with lens, retina, and the muscles needed to focus
automatically. How this happens over millions of years is unknown, for
unless the entire eye is complete, it is useless. But let’s assume it
happened; the eye is complete. Without the nerve connecting it to the
brain, and the brain being able to process the information, the
partially formed eye is useless, and would be selected out since it
gives no advantage to the species. Millions of years of mutations and
natural selection wasted.

But let’s suppose all this happened over millions of years. The eye is
complete, and the connection to the brain works, and the brain is
capable of processing the information. How did two eyes develop? What
told the species you needed two? Since you wouldn’t know the benefits of
two eyes working together to provide depth perception unless you already
had two, how did this develop? The more thinking you do on this, the
more absurd it sounds. Darwin himself knew this was a problem, and the
passage of time since he proposed his theory has not made it any less of
a problem.

> To suppose that the eye, with all its inimitable contrivances for
> adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different
> amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic
> aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I
> freely confess, absurd to the highest degree. (Charles Darwin “The
> Origin of Species” Bantam Books June 1999, page 155)

Darwin explained his problem with two points he felt would solve
this problem:

-   Numerous examples of **species with transitional forms**.
    Unfortunately, this is not the case. As we shall see in another
    section, the fossil record is silent on transitional forms. Has
    anything been found with partial eyes?
-   **Each transitional form is useful** to the species. This is
    difficult to imagine. What good is a partially formed eye? A
    partially formed eye is useless, according to the theory it would be
    selected out.

The mystery of complex organs poses a huge problem for evolution;
partially formed organs are useless. Consider also reproductive organs.
If these developed over millions of years the same problem presents
itself. What good are partially developed reproductive systems? They
serve no purpose so would be selected out. And how did a species
reproduce during the millions of years they were developing? If a
species could reproduce without them, why would they evolve in the
first place?


## LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE

If evolution has been occurring for billions of years, why isn’t there
life elsewhere in the universe? Since the theory says species adapt to
their environment, we can’t say other planets are inhospitable to life —
to our species yes, but life should be able to evolve and adapt to any
environment. It’s not for a lack of looking, but nothing has been found
— not a cell, skeleton, nothing. Why not?


## THE FOSSIL RECORD

This is again embarrassing. As evolution has occurred for billions of
years, and we went from goo to single-celled animals to fish to crawling
up on land, etc, where are the transitional forms? Where is the half
fish half lizard? The fossil record should have hundreds, thousands,
even millions of examples. Where are they? Evolutionists mention 3 or 4
highly debatable ones, but why have they only found a few? For billions
of years of evolution? Strange. It’s not for a lack of looking — how
many people are digging, and for how many decades have they been
searching? There is a deafening silence from the evolutionists on this
issue, and understandably so. If their theory is correct, the evidence
should be there, and it isn’t. Once again, Darwin knew the problem the
fossil record posed for evolution, and probably expected later
scientists to find abundant transitional forms.

> … the number of intermediate varieties, which have formerly existed
> [must] truly be enormous. Why then is not every geological formation
> and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly
> does not reveal any such finely-graduated organic chain; and this,
> perhaps, is the most obvious objection which can be urged against my
> theory. (Charles Darwin “The Origin of Species” Bantam Books June
> 1999, page 230)
>
> But, as by this theory innumerable transitional forms must have
> existed, why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the
> crust of the earth? (ibid, page 144)

For Darwin, of course, he must have felt future people would find these
intermediate species and vindicate his theory. But where are they? After
all the digging, we should have found hundreds, if not thousands
of examples.


## Punctuated Equilibrium

Since the fossil record *doesn’t* have the vast evidence Darwin himself
predicted, a new theory has been advanced — [punctuated equilibrium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuated_equilibrium). This
theory states evolution isn’t really a gradual process, but happens
rapidly for a time, and then stops. In this way, you don’t really expect
much in the fossil record (which is good, since not much has
been found).

Of course, this is based on no evidence at all — the idea comes from a
complete *lack* of support for evolution. Evolution isn’t occurring now
(so we can’t see it), and happened in the past too fast to leave
evidence. Convenient, isn’t it? For what reason did this happen?

Is this what we’re now counting as science? What about the scientific
method, which requires hard data?

But the unanswered question — *why* does evolution start and stop? What
caused punctuated equilibrium in the first place? Once again, no
answers, and no scientific experimental data to support the claim.


## THE BIG BANG

Billions of years ago there was a huge explosion which threw out all the
stuff our universe is made from. Where did the material come from in the
first place? No one knows. It’s been said this isn’t a problem for
evolution, since the theory is only concerned with how life changes over
time (that’s not true anyway, remember the primordial goo we evolved
from — it’s nonliving material). But if you have a theory to explain how
we got where we are today, but can’t explain the origins, what good is
the theory? It’s useless.

This is such a huge problem it must be addressed. It was popular a few
years ago to claim the universe is infinitely old, then this problem
doesn’t present itself. Carl Sagan was well known to promote this
position, and may be responsible for it’s popularity. Only one problem —
it’s wrong. The most recent science shows this can’t be so. A few
excerpts from an article in the Los Angeles Times on May 26, 1999 may
prove helpful (taken from a reprint in the Register-Guard of the same
article on May 26, 1999 titled “Astronomers solve an age-old question”).

A basic law of Physics is matter can neither be created nor destroyed.
So if there is no God, how did the big bang occur? Where did it come
from? Even if we assume everything *after* the big bang can be explained
by evolution (which it can’t), we still are left with this problem.


## EVOLUTION — A THEORY IN TROUBLE

Clearly, by looking at the previous points it’s obvious evolution is a
theory in trouble. There are few answers given for the previous
problems, and no one wants to talk about them. These are not just minor
details to work out; they are significant problems shaking the core of
evolutionary theory. The core argument of evolution involves change over
time. Yet we find neither transitional forms as proof this occurred, nor
can it be explained how gradual change explains the development of
complex systems such as the eye (with each mutation actually providing
a benefit).

It is left to the reader to determine why the fundamental concepts of
evolution have little or no proof — considering the considerable time
evolutionists have expended in search of it. Would other scientific
theories survive this long without proof or with fundamental problems
such as:

* Matter comes from nothing.
* Explosions produce order.
* Non-living goo can suddenly come alive.
* A theory based on no evidence (Punctuated equilibrium).

All three not only have NO experimental evidence for them, they actually
contradict many of the laws we know. They are assumed *a priori* simply
because evolution won’t work otherwise. But where is the experimental
evidence? It doesn’t exist.

As the theory continues to be changed year by year, it’s apparent
evolution doesn’t work. As desperate evolutionists continue to cling to
their dogma and come up with ridiculous claims for which little or no
evidence is ever shown, perhaps the time has come to take a fresh,
open-minded look at the evidence. Until these problems can be addressed
in a scientifically valid manor, it’s a waste of time to talk about the
other parts of the theory. Unless, of course, you accept the theory on
faith alone.
