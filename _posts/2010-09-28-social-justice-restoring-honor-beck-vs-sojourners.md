Glenn Beck’s “Restoring Honor” rally drew much attention, but it also
gave fuel to the on-going feud between Beck and Sojourners’ Jim Wallis,
as a big difference between the views of Beck and Wallis surrounds
“social justice”.

In case you night think he wasn’t clear he’s said the same thing
many times:

<blockquote>
<p>You said social justice was a “perversion of the gospel”, and I countered that to assert that, instead, it is at the heart of the gospel and part of the core meaning of biblical faith. <cite>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-wallis/another-invitation-to-gle_b_497278.html</cite></p>

<p>Social Justice is integral to Biblical faith, it’s at the heart of the Gospel. (MSNBC) <cite>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoD0ceZxRH4</cite></p>

<p>… social justice, which I said was at the heart of the gospel and integral to biblical faith. <cite>http://blog.sojo.net/2010/05/06/glenn-beck-immigration-and-social-justice/</cite></p>
</blockquote>

We’ve covered [social justice and the counterfeit gospel]({% post_url 2010-08-02-social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel %})
before, but for a quick review here’s the definition of social justice:

<blockquote>
<p>Social justice is based on the concepts of human rights and equality and involves a greater degree of economic egalitarianism through progressive taxation, income redistribution, or even property redistribution. <cite>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice</cite></p>

<p>Economic egalitarianism is a state of economic affairs in which equality of outcome has been manufactured for all the participants of a society. It is a founding principle of various forms of socialism, communalism and cooperative economic organization. <cite>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_egalitarianism</cite></p>

<p>Social justice encompasses economic justice. … Within the system of economic justice as defined by Louis Kelso and Mortimer Adler, there are three essential and interdependent principles: The Principle of Participation, The Principle of Distribution, and The Principle of Harmony … The principle of participation describes how one makes “input” to the economic process in order to make a living … The principle of distribution defines the “output” or “out-take” rights of an economic system matched to each person’s labor and capital inputs … The principle of harmony encompasses the “feedback” or balancing principles required to detect distortions of either the input or output principles and to make whatever corrections are needed to restore a just and balanced economic order for all. <cite>http://www.cesj.org/thirdway/economicjustice-defined.htm</cite></p>
</blockquote>

Social justice makes a foundational mistake understanding the gospel; if
you’re wrong on Jesus and the Gospel, you’re likely wrong on everything
else. What is the Gospel? It’s not open for debate, the apostle Paul
exactly defined exactly the Gospel:

> Moreover, brethren, **I declare to you the gospel** which I preached
> to you, which also you received and in which you stand, by which also
> you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to
> you—unless you believed in vain. For I delivered to you first of all
> that which I also received: that **Christ died for our sins according
> to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the
> third day** according to the Scriptures … (1 Corinthians 15:1 NKJV)

In case that’s not clear, here’s the Gospel defined by Paul:

-   Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures.
-   He was buried.
-   He rose again, according to the Scriptures.

Verses the Gospel according to social justice:

-   Economic justice & redistribution (as a basis for socialism), the
    duty of Christians and the essence (the primary part) of the gospel.

So who’s right? It’s your choice, but they can’t *both* be correct.

Social justice *does* believe in forced income redistribution as that’s
the very definition, or “from every man according to his ability, to
every man according to his need”, the classic foundational principle
of socialism.

That’s sufficient to demonstrate mixing far-left political views with
Biblical theology doesn’t work, but consider another attempt at
justifying the opinion:

> In fact, the end of Jesus’ famous sermon in Luke 4, about proclaiming
> “the year of the Lord’s favor,” was a direct reference, according to
> most biblical scholars, to the “year of Jubilee” in the Hebrew
> scriptures, which called for a periodic freeing of slaves, cancelling
> [sic] of debts, and returning land to original owners. It was written
> into the Torah as legal code and not just left up to individual
> charity. It was about “social justice” and even “redistribution” — two
> of the least popular words on your show.

To determine if social justice really is the essence of the gospel, or
if it conflicts with Biblical teaching, we need answers for
the following:

1.  Where does Jesus say to use government to forcefully take from one
    person, and give to another as the government chooses, all in the
    name of charity?
2.  If charity is forced and not a free choice, can it really be called
    charity? If not, then aren’t you out of the realm of how the Bible
    speaks of charity?

Additionally, in the attempt to justify political (not theological)
views, vital points have been missed. First, Christianity is freed from
the Mosaic law; attempting to apply the Jewish Law to Christians doesn’t
make sense. If social justice can be justified by the example of Jubilee
(in the OT Law), which parts of the Mosaic Law apply to Christians and
which don’t? Can a Christian eat ham? If yes, why does that part of the
Mosaic Law *not* apply, while other parts are enforced? Who gets to make
those decisions?

Of course, the issue of the Mosaic Law and Christians was settled early
in the first century — perhaps a review of Acts 15 might be in order.

Jesus didn’t speak of government confiscation. Charity remains a
*private* matter and personal choice. If it’s forced via government (or
any other) confiscation, it’s no longer charity, by definition. Charity
means voluntary giving of resources to others; “Forced charity” is an
oxymoron (self-contradictory).

Mr. Wallis says private charity isn’t sufficient, thus the government
should step in and *force* people to be “charitable”, and then make
distribution as it sees fit. In other words, income redistribution
(commonly called socialism/communism/marxism, etc). However, if Biblical
personal charity isn’t sufficient, why don’t social justice pastors
teach the flock and organize charitable drives, instead of trying to use
the government to forcefully confiscate the resources of some, and give
to others? As a pastor, isn’t teaching the flock the primary duty?

As a side note, we wonder if those claiming Christians can’t be against
government from Romans 13 held the same view during President Bush’s
term. We think not, judging by what appeared in the news during
President Bush’s time in office. Of course, that simply demonstrates
those with shifting views do not differ from any other political figure
refusing to maintain consistency, promoting one view when someone they
like holds the office, and promoting the opposite when someone they
don’t like does.

All Christians (should) agree assisting the truly downtrodden and needy
remains important. However, those claiming Christians must support
“social justice” make several large mistakes.

1.  Charity in the Bible exists privately, while social justice
    proponents frequently state that’s insufficient, and needs forceful
    government action to “help” God along.
2.  In pursuit of that goal, social justice attempts to make the Bible
    fit far-left political views, instead of allowing the Bible to form
    political views. Of course, that’s exactly backwards.

Orthodox Christianity holds Jesus’ taking care of the poor and needy
remains an individual and/or church concept, while social justice
believes (without Biblical support) Jesus meant forceful government
confiscation and redistribution — and even promotes the incorrect idea
social justice comprises the essence of the Gospel, in direct
contradiction to the apostle Paul.

In the end, the Beck verses Wallis/Sojourners becomes a disagreement
over *politics* (not theology) and thus doesn’t involve any religious
issues at all. Both men believe Christians should help the poor via
charity. The difference is *how* — Wallis promotes hard-left political
views (income redistribution), Beck does not.

Strange doctrine and fads periodically blow through the church and claim
many victims. Whenever you hear something strange, ask the person to
Biblically justify their position. If they can’t cite references, their
position has no merit — don’t be taken in by the latest deceptive fads.
