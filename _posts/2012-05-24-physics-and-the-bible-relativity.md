In the final part of this series, we’ll consider Einstein’s Relativity,
and finally put to rest one of the oldest controversies in the Bible
(but you’ll have to wait until the end).

Relativity
----------

What is relativity? Simply stated, **time and events are not absolute**,
they can only be interpreted from a specific point of view. For example,
suppose you watched a lightning storm from your window, and you see two
lightning strikes hit different points on the ground at the same time.

Would it surprise you to learn someone else may *not* see those as
simultaneous events?

Wait a minute, you say. They either did or didn’t hit the ground at the
same time. As Lee Corso says “not so fast, my friend.” You can’t answer
the question absolutely, *only by a specific person’s frame of
reference* — movement and gravity relative to other objects will affect
the notion of simultaneous events.

When I was in Physics class we’d perform some calculations involving
time, and of course arrive at two different answers. Inevitably some
person would raise their hand and ask “which one is correct?” at which
point my professor would grin widely and say, “it’s all relative — see,
Relativity isn’t that hard.”

**It’s a tough concept to wrap your arms around** — the fact time and
the idea of simultaneous events is *not* absolute. The only thing you
can say for sure is in some reference, they were or were not.

We’ll not cover the minute details of relativity, the important (and
difficult) idea is time itself is not absolute, it only can be
interpreted by a specific reference frame.

### Example One: How old is the Universe?

Where does this come up? You might have heard the debate about the age
of the universe, with some claiming billions of years, others 7 days, as
Genesis says. Which is right? You can’t answer the question without
knowing what reference frame you’re talking about.

One thing is clear, from God’s point of view, creation *was* in just six
(24-hour) days. While it’s true the Hebrew in Genesis *could* imply
ages, that’s not the only place creation is spoken of.

> Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work. But the seventh day is
> the sabbath of the LORD thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work,
> thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy
> maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy
> gates. For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and
> all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD
> blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. (Exodus 20:9--11)

Exodus speaks of a normal seven-day week we’re used to, but associates
that with creation, so it’s obvious **creation was six 24-hour days** as
we’re used to, not ages or billions of years.

So What? Example Two: Calvinism vs Arminianism
----------------------------------------------

Okay, you all stuck with us for the big finale, right?

What does relativity imply for the Bible? Let’s solve a great debate in
the church — **God’s predestination versus man’s free will**. Which is
“right”? By now you know the answer — they both are! It all depends on
your frame of reference.

Consider the two extremes of those ideas.

First, suppose man has ultimate free will, in fact, God barely knows
what’s going on, and certainly can’t do much about it. When I get out of
bed in the morning, what eternal question am I faced with?

Fruit Loops or Corn Flakes?

Now consider the other extreme. God pulls your strings, like working a
giant puppet. You have no choice at all in anything, as God controls
every aspect of your life. When I get out of bed in the morning, what
eternal question am I faced with?

Fruit Loops or Corn Flakes?

Obviously, from *man’s* point of view, we have free will. It matters not
if we do or do not actually have it, *we must act as if we do, because
that’s our frame of reference*.

I’d also submit a supreme, all-powerful, all-knowing God is in charge,
or in His reference frame, everything is ultimately going the way He
wants it — after all, it’s His sandbox.

I hear the heckler in the front row — “Sure, but is that in the Bible,
or did you just make it up?”

Consider John’s Gospel, as he says:

> All that the Father giveth me shall come to me

Ah HA! The Calvinist proclaims. You have no choice! It’s God all the
way. But keep reading in John:

> … and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.

Ah HA! The Arminianist proclaims. It’s up to *you*. You’re responsible.

Of course, the kicker to this little problem is both ideas come from a
*single* verse in John (6:37). Which is “right”? They both are — it all
depends on your frame of reference.

Once again, your knowledge of Physics provides insight into the Bible;
in this case solving once and for all a debate which splits churches and
pits Christian against Christian.
