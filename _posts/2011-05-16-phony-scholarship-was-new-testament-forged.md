Mr. Bart Ehrman (who calls himself a “renowned Bible scholar”) returns
with a new book, this time claiming most of the New Testament was
forged. We won’t analyze much of his “scholarship” because similarly to
the [Deutero-Isaiah Hypothesis](/tags.html#deutero-isaiah),
it only takes a few minutes to discover the “scholarship” has no basis
in sound logic and analysis.

In this case, Mr. Ehrman takes aim at the apostle Paul:

<blockquote cite="http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/05/13/half-of-new-testament-forged-bible-scholar-says/">
<p>The scholar also points to a famous passage in 1 Corinthians in which Paul is recorded as saying that women should be “silent” in churches and that “if they wish to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at&nbsp;home.”</p>
<p>Only three chapters earlier, in the same book, Paul is urging women who pray and prophesy in church to cover their heads with veils, Ehrman says: “If they were allowed to speak in chapter 11, how could they be told not to speak in chapter&nbsp;14?”</p>
</blockquote>

Answer: Because Mr. Erhman has no idea what he’s talking about. Instead
of letting the text speak for itself, he *wants* to see errors and
problems where none exist. Since we wrote a book on 1 Corinthians, we’ll
simply quote "The Troubled Church" on this passage:

> Remember the focus of this section — order in the church service. This
> verse results from a cultural issue existing in that day as women sat
> on one side, while men sat on the other.
>
> During the service women asked questions by shouting across the room
> to their husbands. Paul reminds them of proper order; if a lady had a
> question, don’t interrupt the service, wait until they arrived home.
> In the context of previous verses, all must be in order and not
> confusion — it’s not a prohibition of women speaking in church as Paul
> already spoke of women praying and prophesying in chapter 11. **Those
> seeking to apply this verse to a global ban haven’t done their
> homework**.  
> <cite>“The Troubled Church”, page 153–154 ISBN 978-0-9831117-0-2</cite>

We’ve noted Mr. Erhman’s pseudo-scholarship
before, as once again he reveals a total and complete lack of
understanding of the text — a level so complete even atheists reject his arguments,
a group which certainly wants any reason to doubt the Bible as it was
written, yet they honestly note Ehrman’s total lack of actual
scholarship, along with his contradictions and inconsistencies.

Mr. Ehrman provides yet another warning — just because someone might
have a PhD behind their name, calling themselves a renowned scholar,
doesn’t mean you should lend any more credence to their theories than
someone claiming the moon is made of cheese.

Next time we’ll discuss more credible ideas, like the moon landing hoax
… or the Easter bunny.
