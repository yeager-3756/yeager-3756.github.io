Abortion will always remain a hot-button topic because it isn’t possible
to craft a compromise. You either terminate a pregnancy or you don’t. No
middle ground can exist. However, the “Journal of Medical Ethics” came
up with A Modest Proposal concerning babies with Down’s syndrome or
other problems.

<blockquote cite="http://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2012/02/22/medethics-2011-100411.full">
<p>… to <b>bring up such children might be an unbearable burden on</b> the family and on <b>society as a whole, when the state economically provides for their care</b>. … Therefore, we argue that, when circumstances occur after birth such that they would have justified abortion, what we call after-birth abortion should be permissible.</p>

They’re redefining terms in classic
post-modern
style — it’s not infanticide (or murder), it’s just an abortion. If the
life (in their opinion) isn’t worth it, snuff it out.

Note the argument: when the government pays for medical care, they have
the *right* to kill anyone they feel is a burden. Remember this with
nationalized healthcare (aka Obamacare) — there is no free lunch
— you’re trading your life for $$$.

The Journal should have the guts and honesty to call their idea for what
it is — [Logan’s Run](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan's_Run); the
kill-em-if-they’re-not-useful idea isn’t new, and results when you
abandon absolute morality.

For the elites who want to control everything because they think they’re
better than you, it’s not sanctity of life, it’s quality of life *as
they define it*.

It’s just a logical progression of abortion — it’s okay to terminate a
baby because it has some “defect” according to a group, or the baby
isn’t economically worth it. So what’s the difference between second
trimester and after birth? None, says the Journal.

Of course this applies to grandma as well. Not pulling your weight? Have
a doctor — under authority of government — terminate grandma. *It’s the
same argument as with the baby*, and it’s just as repulsive.

That’s where we’re headed folks as a logical extension of abortion.

<p>Many people in Holland, not just the elderly, have felt compelled to carry around “Do not kill me” cards in their wallets should they be in an accident.</p>
</blockquote>

The Netherlands now has [traveling euthanasia trucks](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/mar/01/dutch-mobile-euthanasia-units)
who will kill you for free — because, you know, you’re a burden on
society and not pulling your weight. And if the government pays for your
medical care, they have a vested financial interest in your untimely
demise to save money to pay for the massive debt
they’ve racked up.

That’s the future when you abandon the sanctity of life because you’re
an “unbearable burden on society”, as the Journal says.

Scary times when you can’t trust doctors not to kill your child,
yourself, or grandma. What happened to “do no harm”? It appears the
handicapped, sick, and elderly have the same moral status as that of an
unborn child — kill ’em at will.

Why not? Well, read [Jon Morrow’s story](http://www.copyblogger.com/fight-for-your-ideas/) for starters — we’ll have more on him next week.

… self-evident except to medical ethics and pro-abortion people —
God-given rights only apply if the government’s death panel allows you
to live; I hope those denying God-given rights have a change of
underwear when they *do* meet God.
