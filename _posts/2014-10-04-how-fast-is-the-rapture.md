Popular culture (“Christmas card theology”) creates widely accepted
ideas about Biblical events. The rapture might be the most misunderstood
of those — images of people flying up in the air might be popular, but
they’re not true.

It turns out Paul explained *exactly* how fast the rapture occurs, if
you’re willing to dig a little.

But we’re getting ahead of ourselves. We’ll need a small diversion in
Physics first.

What is Time?
-------------

People misunderstand time, using the terms *analog* and *digital*
without understanding what they mean.

Analog creates images of an old LP record or cassette tape.

Analog recordings are created as some device records sound waves on a
physical medium (tape, vinyl), and another device takes those patterns
and recreates them as sound.

Digital, on the other hand, encodes in binary form — 0 or 1 (1 + 1 = 10,
at least in base 2).

Those files can be encoded by a computer, and the resulting files can be
passed around wirelessly, like iTunes, for example.

Analog versus digital can be viewed as two kinds of watches. One has a
second hand continually sweeping out in constant motion. You watch it
move from 1 second, to 1.5 seconds, and then to 2 seconds.

Digital uses a second hand which “clicks” from one second to the other.
It moves, then stops, then moves. It’s either a second, or it’s not. It
looks like an old stop-motion movie.

It might surprise you to learn *no such thing as analog exists* — the
world is *entirely* digital. To understand that we must discover the
Planck time.

Planck Time
-----------

Along with Einstein’s Relativity
we discovered quantum Physics — the world is *not* analog as we think,
it’s digital.

Simply put, we live in a giant stop-motion production. Time is not
continuous, but digital, moving in small, but discrete, amounts.

What is that amount? 10<sup>–43</sup> seconds. If we return to the watch picture,
the second hand moves 10<sup>43</sup> times per second.

Yes, that’s impossible to see, and to observers it appears as if time
moves continuously in an analog manner.

But it doesn’t.

The important discovery to grasp is *nothing* exists in between those
steps — units of time smaller than 10<sup>–43</sup> seconds simply don’t exist.

That’s hard to understand, so let’s move to something which might be a
bit easier conceptually. It turns out a similar situation exists with
length as well.

The Planck length measures roughly 10<sup>–35</sup> meters. For reference, a
proton (one of this thingys inside an atom) measures roughly 10<sup>–15</sup>
meters.

So we’re talking *really* small length here.

So what? Suppose you took a sheet of paper, and cut it in half. Then in
half again. In theory, we’d imagine we could do this forever, making
smaller and smaller pieces.

That’s not true.

When you get to the Planck length (10<sup>–35</sup> meters), it’s impossible to
divide it again; units of smaller length don’t exist.

The Rapture
-----------

What does all this Planck stuff have to do with the rapture? In one
passage, Paul states we’ll all be changed.

> Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all
> be changed, In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last
> trump; for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised
> incorruptible, and we shall be changed. (1 Corinthians 15:51–52)
>
The word Paul uses for *moment* is
[atomos](http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G823&t=KJV).

Ah ha! Oh wait, I still don’t get it — you might not see the
significance unless you know how atom was defined.

The Greeks believed atoms were the smallest thing which could exist (we
know that’s not true, inside atoms are protons, neutrons, electrons,
quarks, and a host of other stuff), in other words atoms are
*indivisible*.

See it now? Paul says the rapture occurs in an *indivisible* length of
time. Today we know what that is, it’s the Planck time, or 10<sup>–43</sup>
seconds.

That’s fast.

Practical implications
----------------------

That may all be academic so far, so consider some practical
implications.

It’s a year from the rapture, and the people left behind are trying to
figure out what happened. They have advanced equipment, but nobody can
figure out where millions of people went, leaving only a pile of clothes
behind.

Suppose they used a super high speed camera. Normal motion pictures are
16–32 frames per second — movies are nothing more than individual
pictures rapidly shown, which appear to display motion.

If you’ve ever created a flip-book or stop-motion movies (like Gumby),
you see how this works. In the old days with film, you could unroll and
actually see the images.

So future-world tries to figure out what happened. But they can’t.

Why not? Similar to a stop-motion film, they have no information on what
occurred *between* the frames — it is *unknowable* to them.

If they had equipment with the fastest possible speed, they still could
not see anything, because in one frame you’re there, the next you’re
gone — in an *atom* of time, as Paul says.

No matter how hard they try, it won’t be possible for future-world to
determine what happened, until, that is, they discover an old dusty
book, and some guy named Paul.

Oh yeah, my crazy old man used to talk about him, and a strange book
detailing future events. Maybe I should take a look at that…

So What?
--------

Admittedly, this doesn’t have much practical use (unless you’re one of
those left behind), other than being in awe at how Paul could have
understood quantum Physics, thousands of years before Einstein was born.

Paul 1, skeptics 0.
