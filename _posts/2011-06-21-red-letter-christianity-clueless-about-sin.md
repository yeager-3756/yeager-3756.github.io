Another wacky idea blowing through the church is so-called “Red Letter
Christianity”. Many of these movements blow through, distract many, and
then fade away as they desire to redefine God’s Word into something
“seeker friendly” for reasons of social justice or other (bad) ideas.

This week’s lesson comes as a founder of one group (Red-Letter
Christianity) Mr. Campolo (mis/re)defines sin, as he admits the group
Red-Letter “Christianity” is a political movement
— what he calls “progressive evangelicals”.

Although **radical groups might use the same terminology as traditional
Christianity**, they redefine terms to fit their political views; Mr.
Campolo wrote on the Huffington Post “What differentiates Red Letter
Christians from other Christians is our passionate commitment to social
justice — hence, our intense involvement in politics”.

We’ve written before on the social justice
movement, which exists as a far-left progressive political movement
rather than a God-centered religious one. So in the redefinition game,
**what does the progressive liberal Red-Letter “Christian” mean by
sin**? Allow Mr. Campolo to provide his definition, and see if it agrees
with what you’ve read in the Bible.

<blockquote cite="http://www.redletterchristians.org/what-do-you-mean-by-sin/">
<p>From time to time, I have been asked in the academic classrooms where I have taught to define what I mean by sin.  I always respond by saying, “Sin is what diminishes the humanity of another person and of the&nbsp;self.”</p>
</blockquote>

We’ll skip a detailed analysis of the passage and simply notice the
definition coming from **Red-Letter “Christianity” has no reference to
God at all** — an essentially atheist religion devoid of God (or truth).

You must remember when you use the word “sin”, and Mr. Campolo and
associated progressive political “Christians” do, **you’re not talking
about the same thing, even if using the same word**. Let that point sink
in, because it’s critical to understand. The first thing you have to do
when talking to a radical liberal progressive is **get them to define
terms**, as you’ll quickly find out they’ve redefined terms to suit
their ideology.

Suppose you told someone they were living contrary to God’s law
(adultery, drunkenness, etc). **According to Red-Letter Christianity
speaking the truth is sin**, as it had the possibility to make the
person feel sad. Boo-hoo-hoo. Send a Hallmark card.

What a load of stinking manure. Red-letter Christianity — another
non-biblical ideology (wrapped with a thin candy shell of religious
terms hiding it’s radical political ideology) which should be thrown on
the trash heap.

Remember David when he murdered one of his men? What did he say to God
in Psalm 51 — “Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this
evil in thy sight”. No mention of “dehumanizing”, the offense is
*always* against God.

**Mr. Campolo’s ideas remove God** from the equation, reducing sin to
whatever *you* want it to be — it’s not constant, but whatever
“diminishes the humanity” of a person. Not only is God not involved, but
neither is *truth*. According to Mr. Campolo’s definition of sin, if
what you say is true, but it bums someone out, that’s sin on your part.

**Sin is against God**, period. It’s not about dehumanizing another
person or yourself. Those may be *results* of sin, but they’re most
definitely *not* the definition of sin. At best Mr. Camplo’s
redefinition confuses the definition of sin with the results of sin, at
worst Red-Letter Christianity’s version creates a heretical designer
religion centered around man, instead of God.

Where is the absolute inerrant Word of God? Nowhere to be found — only
whatever *man* decides is sin. Classic value relativism, and the removal
of God from Red Letter “Christianity” — reducing Christianity to a
man-centered philosophy which changes day to day.

Don’t fall for the brightly colored thin candy shell of religious
terminology, hiding the deadly poison of heresy inside.

Because it’s 2:59AM.
