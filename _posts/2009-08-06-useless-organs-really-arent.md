Many times you’ll hear both atheists and evolutionists point to
something as a mistake by God as a reason for denying God’s existence
and creation. Various so-called [vestigial organs](http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/evolution/blfaq_evolution_evidence08.htm)
become used as evidence against God, for those organs don’t appear to
perform any function — but perhaps [vestigial organs aren’t so useless](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/07/090730-spleen-vestigial-organs.html).

For example, recently we’ve found out the spleen isn’t so useless
after all:

<blockquote cite="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/04/science/04angier.html?_r=1">
<p>
Scientists have discovered that the spleen, long consigned to the B-list of abdominal organs and known as much for its metaphoric as its physiological value, plays a more important role in the body’s defense system than anyone&nbsp;suspected.</p>
<p>Reporting in the current issue of the journal Science, researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School describe studies showing that the spleen is a reservoir for huge numbers of immune cells called monocytes, and that in the event of a serious trauma to the body like a heart attack, gashing wound or microbial invasion, the spleen will disgorge those monocyte multitudes into the bloodstream to tackle the&nbsp;crisis.</p>
</blockquote>

Hubris describes the problem with both the atheist’s and evolutionist’s
argument — if *they* don’t understand something or how it’s used, it
must be absurd. That logically means they posses all knowledge, for how
can you claim something isn’t needed unless you posses all knowledge?
It’s also a classic case of [confirmation bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) — evaluating any
data as favorable to your hypothesis (in this case, seeing a *lack of
understanding* as proving your idea).
