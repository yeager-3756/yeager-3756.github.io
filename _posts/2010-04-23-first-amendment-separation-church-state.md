The “separation of church and state” phrase gets thrown around
frequently as a first amendment issue, but you’d be surprised to see the
phrase doesn’t appear where it’s frequently credited—in the first
amendment to the Constitution.

> Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
> prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of
> speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to
> assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

Whoops — the magic phrase doesn’t appear. Notice what the amendment
*does* say regarding religion:

-   Congress shall not force (establish) a national religion.
-   Congress shall not prohibit or restrict freedom to worship or other
    expressions of religion.

The founders wanted to make sure no one either forced a particular
religion nationally, or prevented anyone from worshiping whatever they
wanted. If you’re a Christian, great, if you follow Buddha, no problem —
if you’re a druid and worship trees, good for you. If you’re an atheist
and worship Darwin and Dawkins, glad that’s working out for you.

But we are *not* to have a national religion run by the federal
government—a theocracy if you will. Yet many people attempting to force
the country into an atheist secular humanist mold dwell on the first
part of the amendment, and forget the second. Paul Fidalgo, the
communications manager for the Secular Coalition for America makes that
mistake as he responds after Sarah Palin called the United States a
Christian nation:

<blockquote cite="http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2010/April/Palin-Draws-Heat-over-Christian-Nation-Remarks/">
<p>While the founders’ views on religion varied from person to person, there is no doubt that <b>they believed strongly that religion had no place in government</b>…</p>
<p>Our Constitution established a <b>secular government and has no mention of Jesus, Christianity, or a god of any kind</b>, despite the false message spread by figures such as Sarah Palin who claim that America was founded as a Christian nation,” Fidalgo continued</p>
</blockquote>

No place in government? Not so—they prayed before sessions, posted the
ten commandments, and so on; history shouts the error of Mr. Fidalgo. As
they *included* religion in their government, Mr. Fidalgo remains
factually incorrect just as if he claimed the sky is orange or 2+2=5;
his statements are absurd in their stunning factual errors; we’ll just
cite [examples of God and Jesus in government](http://www.wallbuilders.com/libissuesarticles.asp?id=121),
which contradicts his assertion the founders believed “religion had no
place in government”.

> Whereas, the people of these United States, from their earliest
> history to the present time, have been led by the hand of a kind
> Providence and are indebted for the countless blessings of the past
> and present, and dependent for continued prosperity in the future upon

And for the objection of using chaplains in Congress? If, as Mr.
Fidalgo, says the founders believed “religion had no place in
government”, perhaps he could [explain the following](http://www.wallbuilders.com/libissuesarticles.asp?id=121)
as well:

> The whole view of the petitioners seems founded upon mistaken

Quite a difference exists between government forcing national religion
on its citizens, and freely allowing religious expression even (gasp!)
in government. The first is unconstitutional, the second most certainly
is not (as we’ll get to shortly).

The first amendment involves freedom *to* religion (whatever religion
means for you—Christianity, Buddhism, atheism, Judaism, etc), *not* the
freedom *from* religion many people try to make it; examining how the
founders and government acted in those early days makes this abundantly
clear. By attempting to force their [religion of atheism](/tags.html#series-atheism-and-agnosticism) onto others, those people try to prohibit the free exercise of someone’s religion.

Freedom of religion isn’t freedom *from* religion, it means if your
faith lies with Jesus, Buddha, atheism ([yes, atheism requires faith]({% post_url 2010-01-16-atheism-definition %})), or the tree in your
backyard, you’re free to do so. It does *not* mean you won’t hear other
points of view, or you have the right to force others to refrain from
religious expression simply because you don’t want to hear it. What
happened to [tolerance and honoring diversity]({% post_url 2009-04-21-tolerance-redefined %})?
If someone has beliefs you don’t hold, sit quietly and respectfully
while they observe their faith. Is that not the very definition of
tolerance and honoring diversity?

Thus if a student wants to mention God, Jesus or Buddha in their school
speech, it *must* be allowable, as it *can’t* be a government
establishment of religion for the simple reason the student isn’t a
government official. Additionally, the early founders included religion
in daily government activities; the idea the founders meant the first
amendment required an atheist secular society fails to stand the test
of history.

But some atheists attempt to twist the first amendment into an
I-never-want-to-hear-God idea, which it clearly was never intended to
be—by studying how the founders acted in those early years, this becomes
abundantly obvious; a [Supreme Court ruling in 1952](http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0343_0306_ZO.html)
noted the country is religious, and should not prefer atheism
over religion.

> We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme
> Being. … When the state encourages religious instruction or cooperates
> with religious authorities by adjusting the schedule of public events
> to sectarian needs, it follows the best of our traditions. For it then
> respects the religious nature of our people and accommodates the
> public service to their spiritual needs. To hold that it may not would
> be to find in the Constitution a requirement that the government show
> a callous indifference to religious groups. That would be preferring
> those who believe in no religion over those who do believe.  
> <cite>Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U. S. 306 (1952)</cite>

The Supreme Court acknowledged the religious background of the country
which should end the silly discussion about the historical religious
nature of the country; a debate can ensue whether the founders had the
correct idea in the way they handled religion in government (that’s a
matter of opinion, not fact), but by examining history it’s obvious Mr.
Fidalgo’s laughably absurd claim demonstrates a stunning and complete
failure to acknowledge facts.

No matter how often he, other atheists, and history-deniers repeat
erroneous claims, the claims remain factually wrong.

This case is closed—next time, we’ll discuss more credible theories …
like the moon landing hoax.
