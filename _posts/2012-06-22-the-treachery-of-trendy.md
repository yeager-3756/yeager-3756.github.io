Many Christians adopt trendy value-relativism philosophy because they’re
unprepared and/or uninformed. Ideas like social justice,
collective salvation, replacement theology,
and more are all trendy, popular … and totally incorrect and not found
in the Bible.

How can such Biblically unjustified, completely wrong concepts deceive
so many people?

It’s a failure of public education
as students fail to reason.
As public schools continue to fail, it’s not surprising the lack of
logic and critical thinking infests the church and theology, leaving
many Christians open to deception or the latest trendy fad.

Many people simply can’t logically follow facts to arrive at a reasoned
conclusion.

For example, I’ve written extensively on [Bible translation]({% post_url 2009-01-01-which-bible-translation-best %})
so it’s a subject I follow closely. Recently on a few blogs the question
arose — which translation do you use, and why?

One person was thrilled to finally find a translation agreeing with
their strange ideology in an off-the-path translation. That’s trying to
form the Bible from ideology, and is of course exactly backwards.

Worse, I didn’t find a *single* comment along the lines of “which
translation most accurately matches the original language.” Lots of
notes about how one “speaks” to me, others that it fit their
preconceived ideology, but *nobody* was interested in accuracy (at least
not to the original language).

Tragic, but not surprising as the inability to use logic and critical
thinking makes its way out of the public schools and into the church as
social justice, post-this, emerging-that are all ideas having no basis
at all in the actual Bible.

We’ve replaced facts and logic with popular fads.

It’s time to get your critical thinking hat on and get back in the game,
because it’s 2:59 AM, and you’ll soon face the question — what parts of
Christianity will you not compromise on? Will you stand up to heretical
— but popular — church fads?

You can only respond if you know what the Bible actually says, and can
logically follow the truth. For those interested in an easy to read
primer on logic, Jason Lisle’s “Discerning Truth” is highly recommended
(ISBN 978-0890515945). Once you get some basics down, you’ll be
*stunned* to notice how often major errors are made, and a total lack of
substance in many discussions.
