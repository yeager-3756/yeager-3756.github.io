summary: The ability to think clearly (logic) isn't taught in school much anymore. Perhaps that's why we see so many people easily duped.

This is the first post in a series on logic. In discussions on many
diverse topics, it’s common to discover errors in critical thinking. Why
is this important? It surprises people to learn the church will be infested
with false teachers who — either from maliciousness or ignorance — lead
astray many people.

Heresies thrive on the inability of people to think clearly and analyze
correctly. As Paul said, be a Berean and search daily to see if what
you’re hearing is true.

Sadly, many pew-warmers exist swallowing any poison coming their way, as
long as Friday’s pot-luck was good. Paul warned Timothy about exactly
such a time.

In other words, Paul told you to be a *healthy* skeptic.

Logic provides the tool to get the job done, avoid heresy, ripoffs, and
understand why what you believe is true.

If you’re (ahem) youth-challenged, you might recall the old Camel
cigarette ad, asking the question “What cigarette do you smoke, doctor?”
And the brand named most, was Camel. Yes, according to a survey, more
doctors smoke Camels, than any other cigarette.

Today we laugh at the absurdity of the ad. Yet back in the day, it
likely was quite effective.

Why?

The ad appealed to someone who should know — doctors — and the idea many
of them agreed on the best cigarette.

Appealing to your sense of (misguided) reason (*not* logic), the ad
contains several logical mistakes, specifically the *argument from
majority* and *argument from authority* errors (which we’ll discuss
later, don’t worry).

History is filled with logical errors — everything from Piltdown man to
flat earth.

But first, we must define terms. What is logic?

Common Sense
------------

Common sense isn’t logic, but reason, and the two can be easily
confused.

For example, when speaking to an atheist I pointed out the logical
absurdity of atheism, he responded with “but theism isn’t?”. He confused
*logic* with *common sense* — in his eyes God violated common sense, and
was thus illogical.

As another example, many hold the strange idea Isaiah didn’t write the
book bearing his name — the so-called deutero-Isaiah hypothesis.
The idea comes from analyzing the style of different sections, and
concluding some amount of differences proves different authors.

The theory says at least three guys existed: The guy who wrote the first
half, the second half, and the guy who compiled it.

They have no reason (other than their guess) to believe those guys
existed, they don’t know who they were, or why they did what they did.

The only reason to believe three mysterious people exist is because
their theory (multiple authors) demands it.

That violates common sense and sound research.

Logic
-----

Logic uses defined rules to arrive at an answer. It’s similar to
mathematics. If you see the expression <span class="code">(2 + 3) X 5 +
1 = ?</span> you understand how to correctly compute the answer because
mathematics uses clearly defined rules.

Some might say in violation of common sense, but in the end if
mathematical rules are followed, everyone understands the answer will be
correct.

Logic allows you to follow a defined path, and arrive at a valid answer.
It is not necessarily a *proof*, however.

In the atheism vs theism discussion, we have no need to discuss atheism,
as it contains nothing but immature gibberish, like the sentence
*chimney yes the beneath*.

Atheism is illogical for the
simple reason you can’t say God doesn’t exist unless you posses all
knowledge. If you don’t, God can exist outside your knowledge.

<img class="centered svg-resize" src="/images/2014/04/atheism-diagram.svg" alt="atheism diagram" height="150" width="150" />

“A” represents your knowledge, while all knowledge by “B.” No matter how
large “A” becomes, it will *never* be as large as “B,” thus God could
exist anywhere outside the box of your knowledge unknown to you.

That’s why atheism is immature gibberish. No reason exists to even
*discuss* it. I’ve talked to many so-called atheists, and I’ve yet to
meet *one* who actually *is* an atheist, for the simple reason most
understand the failed logic of atheism.

Only someone who does not understand logic could hold to atheism.

Theism, however, *is* logical; it does not *prove* God exists, only that
theism follows logic and is rational.

Logic and critical thinking remains vital, whether you’re discussing
politics, mathematics, atheism, or Christianity.

Let’s *briefly* use logic to solve a centuries old issue — can you lose your salvation?

One tactic in logic is indirect proof. Begin with a statement you don’t
know the truth of, deduce from it, and if you arrive at a contradiction,
your original statement *must* be false.

Let’s assume you *can* lose your salvation. What does that imply? Your
salvation is not eternal, it can come and go.

Wait, doesn’t the Bible speak about eternal salvation? What does eternal
mean? Forever. If you can lose it, it’s not forever, which is a
contradiction, thus the original idea (you can lose your salvation)
*must* be in error.

Using logical methods, no need exists to visit the proof-texts one side
or the other uses.

Failure to follow logic can lead you into all sorts of problems, from
economic disaster to heresy.

You don’t want that, do you?
