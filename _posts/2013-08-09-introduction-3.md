As political correctness runs amok over society, some ideas have become
taboo — areas even Christians don’t venture to discuss much for fear of
“offending”; the new morality doesn’t bother with *truth*, but what is
non-offensive. While popular movies and TV shows involve vampires and
the occult, the one subject we aren’t allowed to speak of: spiritual
warfare. That’s only the realm of crazy people, right? We’ve grown
beyond thinking Satan exists, right?

Sadly, many in the church aren’t ready to face the opposition, and if they do find
themselves in a “serious social occasion,” their encounter won’t end
well as they look down in their
toolbox and discover … nothing.

God provides complete weaponry, however, money, fame, fortune, and IQ
won’t help. Misunderstanding of reality causes people to make two
mistakes regarding spiritual warfare.

1.  Satan is behind every door.
2.  Satan doesn’t exist.

The first looks like the old Saturday Night Live “Church Lady” skits
with Dana Carvey. Remember the tag line? Sooner or later the Church Lady
says “could it be … SATAN?”. When you stub your toe, it’s Satan.

That’s a bit over the edge, and you can rest assured if you drink too
much and crash your car into a telephone pole, it’s your own stupidity —
not Satan — causing it.

The second error is just as bad, denying the truth and reality of Satan.

He exists. He’s real. He’s against you. He plots. He waits.

You need balance. Yes, Satan exists. Yes, he’s plotting against you. But
no, he’s not behind every door. Those not accepting the balanced truth
choose to live in The Matrix of deception.

Don’t be one of those.

The classic list of God’s armor appears in Ephesians 6, as Paul has a
bit of free time to write while chained to a Roman soldier, as he finds
himself once again in prison.

Before you continue, you’ve got a choice to make. Do you want to be
comfortable in deception, or engage and make a difference?

Sure, that question is *easy* while sitting comfortably. But once the
fur begins to fly, it’s easy to forget, and desire to go back to
delusion. Becoming a sheepdog
isn’t a part-time job, not something you turn on and then off.

You either are — or are not — combat-ready.

> Ready are you? What know you of ready? … A Jedi must have the deepest
> commitment, the most serious mind. – Yoda

I hope you’re ready; let’s begin with Paul’s introduction.

> Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against
> the wiles of the devil. (Ephesians 6:11)

Paul states why you need God's armor — to make your stand, as in a
*military* stand. Yes, spiritual warfare is real. Yes, it’s a battle.
Yes, if you’re not prepared you’ll be a casualty.

However, even among those who understand reality, you’ll hear them when
things go sideways — Oh, I’m just so under attack right now.

That’s an excuse for a pathetic or non-existent response. Remember when
Jesus told Peter on this rock I will build my church, *and the gates of
Hell shall not prevail* against it?

What is a gate used for? It’s a *defensive* item. It’s designed to keep
the other offense out.

Are you on offense or defense? It’s time to switch, and understand 
[Wile E. Coyote’s guide to offense]({% post_url 2013-01-25-wile-e-coyotes-guide-to-offense %}).

In a word: [Nuts!]({% post_url  2012-12-28-nuts %}).

General Paul will detail your equipment, but in his introduction reminds
us we need the *whole* armor, and must depend on nothing else.

-   If you’re missing a piece or two you won’t be very successful (read
    that: you’ll be slaughtered like a pig).
-   If you’re untrained in its use you won’t prosper
-   If you’re counting on someone else to join the battle you’ll fail
