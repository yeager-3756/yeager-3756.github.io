Atheists try to escape the absurdity of their position (the only way you
can say God doesn’t exist is by having all knowledge, since if you don’t
God can exist outside your knowledge) by silly arguments, some even go
so far to attempt *proof* God doesn’t exist. But those attempts always
fail as they fall into the same logical problem.

<blockquote cite="http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=3115">
<ol>
<li>If God exists, God is an omnipotent and wholly good being.</li>
<li>A good being always eliminates evil as far as it can.</li>
<li>There are no limits on what an omnipotent being can do.</li>
<li>Evil exists.</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, God does not exist.</p>
</blockquote>

The only real debatable point comes from #2 — will God *always*
eliminate evil if He can? If we assume God is good, all-powerful,
all-loving, all-knowing, why *wouldn’t* He save starving children,
eliminate disease, stop wars, and so on?

The atheist makes a major logical error in that point as well, and the
author even points it out as a problem.

<blockquote cite="http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=3115">
<p>If it is even possible that God has a morally justifying reason to permit evil, then there is no logical contradiction between the existence of evil and the existence of a good, omniscient, omnipotent God.</p>
</blockquote>

So where’s the error? The atheist finds himself right back at square one
— the only way to state no reason exists for God to allow evil is if you
have all knowledge, and surely the atheist won’t claim that. The atheist
sometimes uses some mysterious, unknowable God to distract attention
from their problem, which is a basic error in logic and analysis.

The nature of God isn’t at issue — by definition He is all-knowing and
benevolent — rather, the atheist makes the mistake he has the same
knowledge and experience of God — it’s an error attributed to hubris.

Atheism is illogical, as any
attempt to *prove* God doesn’t exist makes the nasty assumption you
posses all knowledge. Perhaps that’s why many atheists now claim more of
an agnostic position — there’s no *reason* to believe in God. That is a
more reasonable position than the atheist, at least one standing on more
solid logical ground, even if we’d disagree with the agnostic
conclusion.

In the end atheism makes no sense, always finding itself trapped by its
own absurdity.
