We wrote about the gender neutral NIV
translation back in 2009, but an interesting note of the perils of the
trendy “gender neutral” translation come from none other than staunch
anti-religious atheist Christopher Hitchens.

<blockquote cite="http://www.christianpost.com/news/atheist-hitchens-praises-king-james-bible-49686/">
<p>Hitchens called the contemporary version “pancake-flat” and more suited for “a basement meeting of&nbsp;A.A.”</p>
<p>“These words could not hope to penetrate the torpid, resistant fog in the mind of a 16-year-old boy, as their original had done for me,” he said in his&nbsp;commentary.</p>
<p>He also rejected the gender neutral language of substituting “brethren” with “my friends,” calling it a “slightly ingratiating&nbsp;obeisance.”</p>
<p>“<b>Tto suggest that Saint Paul, of all people, was gender-neutral is to re-write the history</b> as well as to rinse out the prose,” Hitchens&nbsp;noted.</p>
</blockquote>

This isn’t the first time Hitchens’ theology surpassed that of supposed “Christian” scholars,
It’s a reminder not all who call themselves Christians really *are*
Christians.

Don’t fall for the “argument from authority” mistake. Just because
someone claims a pastorship, or has a degree from seminary doesn’t mean
they’re right. They can easily be attempting to pass you deception
straight from the pit of hell. In short, do your own homework and don’t
believe what you’re told without checking it out yourself (trust me, I’m
a doctor).

It’s a shame more pastors and “scholars” don’t have the understanding
atheist Hitchens does, but that’s a sad commentary on the state of the
church, and illustrates the problem of people blindly accepting
arguments from authority.

Why do “scholars” consistently feel the need to re-write the Bible to
suit their bias?
