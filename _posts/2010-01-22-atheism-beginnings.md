One of the oldest (and most common) questions of life is “how did I get
here?” You’ve got several choices to choose from.

1.  Evolution — first there was nothing, and then it exploded. Then goo
    formed, then amino acids, then life, then through mutations became
    what we see today.
2.  God — an eternal being created the cosmos.
3.  Aliens placed us here 10 minutes ago with all memories intact (we’ve
    heard that before, seriously).
4.  We’re in the Matrix.

Evolution makes many assumptions about what may or may not have happened
billions of years ago (“first there was nothing, and then it exploded”),
simply because they’re *required* for evolution to occur. But that’s not
science. The [scientific method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) involves
repeatable, experimental data. If you don’t have that, it’s not science
— **by definition**. So where is the experimental evidence for the
following? If you don’t have repeatable, verifiable experimental data
for it it’s not science, and you can’t answer the question (via science)
of how did I get here?

1.  Matter comes from nothing.
2.  Non-living material can spontaneously become alive.
3.  Species can change from one to another.
4.  Explosions produce order.

Evolution doesn’t work — even [Dawkins admits a god exists]({% post_url 2009-09-24-richard-dawkins-proves-god-exists-mistake %}).
If you believe “from the goo to the zoo to you” you need repeatable,
scientific experiments for it. If you don’t have that, you accept
evolution on faith, not science.

Dawkins states how the universe came into existence *is* evolution. And
his theory about evolution is “first there was nothing, and then it
exploded” followed by the goo … to the zoo … to you! All without
experimental data to support it. Where are the experiments showing
matter comes from nothing? For non-life becoming life? Of course, that’s
not the only problem Dawkins and his disciples need to answer:

> Nevertheless, it may be that the origin of life is not the only major
> gap in the evolutionary story that is bridged by sheer luck,
> anthropically justified. — Richard Dawkins “The God Delusion” page 140

Where’s the science? By Dawkins’ own admission, he’s postulated a lucky
theory-of-the-gaps, where he has a start and end point, and in the
middle only exists “poof—some magic happened” — completely without any
scientific experimental evidence or observation in the lab. Where are
the experiments *proving* life comes from non-life, or matter comes from
nothing? Dawkins takes evolution on faith, not science.

Some say evolution doesn’t involve these questions concerning the
beginning of the cosmos and matter itself (even though Dawkins
disagrees), but we still need to answer the question: how did I get
here? If you want to ignore the foundation and start on the 13th floor,
fine. Where are the experiments showing massive quantities of mutations
create new species? This gets to be an argument over what a species is,
but for the bit we’ll gloss over that issue to focus on another problem
— lack of information.
