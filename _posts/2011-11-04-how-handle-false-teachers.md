Many so-called “pastors” or teachers don’t exactly proclaim what the
Bible does. Some add, some deny, some change meanings. How should a
Christian handle those who claim to follow the Bible, yet really don’t?

> And it shall come to pass, that when any shall yet prophesy, then his
> father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt
> not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the LORD: and his
> father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he
> prophesieth. (Zechariah 13:3)

First, let’s be very clear: this is *not* advocating swords today, as
it’s applies for Israel in a different time. Do *NOT* think you need to
get a sword and start running people through. Clear?

In a broad sense however, how do we handle people who say “Thus saith
the Lord”, and yet speak falsely? It’s easy to claim to speak for the
Lord, but many people (i.e. pastors) get it wrong. Do we tolerate false
prophets and teachers? What should we do?

For example, a debate was held recently on the definition of the gospel.
Why? This is one area such a word is explicitly defined by Paul:

> Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached
> unto you … Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And
> that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to
> the scriptures (1 Corinthians 15)

Thus, anybody unclear on the gospel definition either hasn’t found 1
Corinthians 15, believes Paul was wrong, or is peddling an alternate
unBiblical “gospel”. In view of Paul’s next warning, that last option
isn’t a very good one:

> But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto
> you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.
> (Galatians 1:8)

So why debate? It’s abundantly clear. When progressive “Christians”
claim social justice is integral to the gospel, is that what Paul said?
“For I declare to you the gospel: lobby for social justice from the
government”. Oops, that’s not what Paul said, is it?

Thus, it’s abundantly obvious they’re wrong — social justice has
*nothing* to do with the gospel.

The debate should have been short — here’s what Paul said, we’re done
defining the gospel. And therein lies the clue about how *we* should
handle such false and deceptive ideas.

> For the word of God is living, and powerful, and sharper than any
> two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and
> spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the
> thoughts and intents of the heart. (Hebrews 4:12)

You don’t need to engage in debates, just read the Word. Many of those
peddling false ideas either have no idea their bizarre ideas conflict
with clear and obvious teaching in the Bible, or hope you won’t do your
homework for yourself and discover just how wrong they are.

When heretics claim “the Bible must be modernized for today”, or “Paul
didn’t really mean what he wrote”, or “Paul really meant an allegory
for…”, or other nonsense, you’ll immediately identify such as tactics
of rebellion.

Let the Word of God handle it, those promoting alternate gospels of social justice),
post-modern this, emerging-that are not only wrong, but un Biblical and
using tactics of rebellion.

Let others argue, stand firm on the Rock of God’s Word. You don’t need
to watch debates, simply proclaim God’s truth and ask — do you accept
that or not, and watch as they try and claim to accept the Bible, all
while denying it.
