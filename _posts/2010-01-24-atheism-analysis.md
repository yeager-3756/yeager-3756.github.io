Let’s look at agnosticism and see if there’s something to discuss. If
you’re an atheist, don’t bother with this as your position comes from
faith (not critical thinking), and nothing will ever shake the dogma of
your convictions.

### Questions of Life

The basic questions of life are:

1.  How did I get here?
2.  Why am I here?
3.  Where am I going?

Number 2, and to a lesser extent number 3 can be relegated to philosophy
if you wish, and assuming you take an agnostic view, they will be
philosophical as if no supernatural being exists philosophy can be the
only explanation (although it will always leave you wanting).

### Which god is God?

But how did I get here? Since evolution admits *a* god is required — it
could be Judeo-Christian or your coffee can — the issue immediately
becomes which one?

<blockquote cite="http://twitter.com/Newlady1/status/4376600108">
<p>But by your argument, if you can’t say A god doesn’t exist, then you can’t say ANY doesn’t exist and therefore all exist. :/</p>
</blockquote>

Not quite. You can’t say God doesn’t exist, but that does not mean all
gods *do* exist. Logic does not imply proof. It only means a god *can*
exist logically, and those stating flatly “God does not exist” display
their faulty logic — atheism bases its belief on *faith*, not logic;
many would call it religion (but that’s a topic for another time).

We’re left with the necessity of a “god” — a higher force even Dawkins
admits evolution uses in natural selection. You can call it god, the
force, or the tree in your backyard, but *something* (which we’ll call
god) exists. Of course, that leads to the following problem.

<blockquote cite="http://twitter.com/Newlady1/status/4376473439">
<p>By your argument, Zeus, Shiva, Anansi, etc. cannot be said to not exist. What then do you do with choosing one over others?</p>
</blockquote>

Well stated and correct. You can’t say (logically) those don’t exist.
What you *can* do is examine them and see if they make sense. But unless
you possess all knowledge, they could exist outside your experience, so
it’s not proof. Remember, by definition no proof can exist of the
supernatural so the position of requiring proof of the supernatural is
an inherent contradiction. Reasonable conclusions, yes, proof, no.

But choosing one over the others is exactly the problem. First off, most
religions are exclusive and claim to be the only way, and the only true
god. Thus, by simple reasoning, only one *can* be correct — it’s your
job to find it. But how?

#### Choosing a god

Back to our problem — how did we get here? Eastern philosophy excludes
itself as it can’t answer the question. Zeus and others as well. Very
few gods claim to be involved in creation, and some of them are
not all-powerful.

In the end you basically arrive with Judaism, Christianity, Islam and
perhaps a few other candidates — the monotheistic religions. Analyze
those and find the best fit. As to further discussion on the various
possibilities, the rest of our site deals with Bible study and so on, so
we’ll leave it for further discussion for the interested seeker
of truth.
