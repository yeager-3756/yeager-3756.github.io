Some people desire to reconcile the six-day creation from Genesis with
evolution’s billions of years. Appearing impossible to reconcile does
not prevent people from making the attempt; suppose a period of time
existed not detailed in the Bible — a gap between events? Maybe we can
cram evolution in that space.

That’s the gap theory.

Let’s begin on page one.

> In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. (Genesis 1:1)

Clear so far. God created (the details appear later in Genesis) in six
days. What next?

> And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the
> face of the deep. (Genesis 1:2)

Here’s where it gets interesting. The Hebrew translated “was” can also
mean became or come to pass. Simply put, God did *not* create the earth
void, it became that way *after some indeterminate period of time*.

How long? Billions of years, by the gap theory.

The Gap Fail
------------

Poof! Now we can cram evolution’s billions of years into the Bible.
Yippe!

Only it doesn’t work.

If you know a little about dating processes, you know they rely on a
common strategy — decay. Some measurable quantity over a period of time
changes or decays, and thus roughly determines age.

How does this cause the gap theory to fail? In the garden (before sin),
no decay existed, thus no method to measure time, thus, as far as what
we can measure, no time passed.

Using the gap theory in the attempt to get billions of years into
Genesis fails miserably.

The Gap Works!
--------------

Yet at least part of the theory is true. A gap *does* exist between
verse 1 and 2 in Genesis.

What happened in that gap? The fall of Satan, detailed in Isaiah
14:12–17 and Ezekiel 28:13–15. That’s why the earth became void.

Yes, a gap exists between verse 1 and 2 in Genesis.

Yes, it was an indeterminate period of “time” (did time exist in the
garden?).

But no, it’s not the billions of years evolution requires.
