summary: Whatever you do, do not ask for scientific proof for evolution. You'll get everything *but* data according to the scientific method. And if evolution fails to follow scientific method, it is not science by definition. Its adherents accept it on faith.

Throughout history, simple inquiries in science start
firestorms of controversy. While we certainly don’t claim to be in the same
league as Einstein (and his quantum theory), our simple query regarding
evolution and the scientific evidence supporting it generate much
response. As we’ve [written before](/categories#evolution),
we seek simple answers to scientific questions
using the scientific method. Nothing more, nothing less.

Introduction
------------

-   Matter can come from nothing.
-   Non-living material can become alive.
-   Explosions produce order.
-   Species change into another.

Nothing radical here, just basic foundational principles
of evolution.

It’s important before continuing to establish exactly
what science is, and the principle means of its advancement, the
scientific  method. Understanding the scientific method allows cutting through the
fog, misplaced passion and personal attacks (which have no place
in science).

### The Scientific Method

<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method">
<p>A scientific method or process is
considered fundamental to the scientific investigation and acquisition of
new knowledge based upon physical evidence. Scientists use observations,
hypotheses and deductions to propose explanations for natural phenomena in
the form of theories. Predictions from these theories are tested by
experiment. If a prediction turns out to be correct, the theory survives.
Any theory which is cogent enough to make predictions can then be tested
reproducibly in this way. The method is commonly taken as the underlying
logic of scientific practice. A scientific method is essentially an
extremely cautious means of building a supportable, evidenced understanding
of our natural world.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Observation, reason, and experiment make up what we
call the scientific method. (Richard Feynman “The Feynman Lectures on Physics”, Volume I page&nbsp;2-1)</p>
</blockquote>

The scientific method is simple — make a
hypothesis and then perform experiments to prove or disprove the
hypothesis, using reason to determine if the theory fits in with
established understanding.

Evolution is a hypothesis. If it’s true with
overwhelming evidence we should have proof for the previously
mentioned  ideas, correct? If not, it’s not science. No (reputable) scientist
disagrees with the scientific method — it’s the basis for all fields
of science (except one, as we shall see).

### Logical Errors

Before beginning the responses, it’s important to
understand common logical errors. This issue involves science —
nothing more, nothing less. It’s analyzing evidence for evolution,
scientific data and experimental results to prove its validity. A
simple request for data is asked, and a simple response with peer-reviewed
experimental data is the only requirement (citing articles
and journals).

Yet two common logical errors frequently occur in
this discussion — the ad hominem attack, and the dummy subject (also
known as the straw man). Any time you see these errors (and a lack of
data), you should question why the author fails to stay on a
scientific
subject. Science is about data. Period.

<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>ad hominem</strong>
argument — the argument, as the Latin phrase says, “to the
man” — is a second common form [of error]. Here, the tactic is to
condemn the morals, motives, friends or family of one’s opponent and hence
to divert attention away from the substance of the opponent’s
argument.</p>
<p>The <strong>dummy subject</strong> is another device
commonly used for avoiding the question. As the label implies, the
technique is to stuff, set up, and knock down a dummy issue that is
substituted for the real issue.
(“The Heath Handbook”, twelfth edition, 1990 page&nbsp;281)</p>

A simple scientific inquiry for evolutionists to demonstrate
*scientifically* the data they have proving their
hypothesis. No personal attacks, no mention of the Bible, creation, God
or  anything else — it’s about science and the evidence. Either the data
exists, or it doesn’t. Either way, let’s get the cards on the table.

Yet this simple scientific inquiry started a
firestorm of responses.

Responses
---------

### Response one

This student gets a “A” for effort, but fails answering the question,
spending time on a list which was only bonus credit hoping the extra credit
would hide the “F” in answering the previous questions (it doesn’t).

The claim none of these questions have anything to
do with evolution is false; <span class="pullquote">science bases
results on the work of previous
ideas in much the same way as a building rises from the
foundation.</span> To say
these basic questions have nothing to do with evolution is to say the
Sears Tower has no need of the foundation sunk into the Chicago bedrock
beneath it. Without a base, building is impossible. If the base fails, so does
the building.

In the same way, evolution ignores fundamental,
unresolved issues at its base. It’s trying to build a building, but
beginning on the third story in the middle of the air. It doesn’t work,
and ignoring fundamental issues is unscientific.

It’s about science and experimental data.

Where is the experiment showing life comes from
non-life? That’s all we want to know. For the big bang, for what reason
do you believe an explosion would produce order when it’s never been
observed? Where is the experimental data?

As for species changing, where is the data? Some
experiments using moths changing color or the equivalent turn up
frequently, and then the great (unscientific) leap is made this shows
species can change into another. But in the end, the moth is still a
moth. It never changed species.

Sure, we can selectively breed dogs, yielding the
dachshund and the mastiff. But they’re still both dogs. Where is the
data if species changing into another has been “observed in nature and the
laboratory” (two citations needed, one for nature, one for the lab)?

Give him an “A” for effort, and a “D-” for science.

When did religion enter into this
discussion? <span class="pullquote">We’re talking about scientific data
and experiments, and the
lack of same for evolution.</span> Why digress into both ad hominem and
straw man arguments? The only response needed is the answer to a scientific
question. The respondent has no scientific discussion at all, instead wandering
off-topic. Let’s stay on the discussion — it’s about science and
experimental data.

The final paragraph is the classic straw man —
claiming economic problems for simply asking for scientific evidence
for a theory in which its proponents claim massive, overwhelming evidence
(as long as you don’t ask to see it). The truth or falsity of evolution is
what it is, and blaming economic problems on it isn’t a scientific problem.
If having the moon made of cheese was good for the economy, should we
allow science that falsity as well?

It’s about science and experimental data.

### Response Three

Why waste all those hours in college when we have the Internet? The Internet can be
a fabulous resource, but much of what it contains is sketchy at best.

This person cites no scientific data either; no
answer for the fundamental questions. If the class had any reputable
instructor, they must have covered the scientific method. Where is
the data?

It’s about science and experimental data.

### Response Four

Profound misunderstanding of the scientific
method? Let’s remind ourselves what the scientific method is, as
Richard Feynman explains:

> Observation, reason, and experiment make
>  up what we call the scientific method.
>  (Richard Feynman “The Feynman Lectures on Physics”, Volume I page 2-1)

Religious beliefs don’t belong here. <span class="pullquote">The
question is science, the scientific method, and the evidence (or lack
thereof) for a theory.</span> Whether evolution runs counter to any
religion is irrelevant; it’s about science and experimental data. And for the
record, many religious people do believe in evolution (*that*
discussion is for another time), but what people believe is irrelevant
in a scientific discussion. It’s about science and experimental data.

“The scientific community’s overwhelming support
for evolution” is also irrelevant. Remember Piltdown man? Once heralded
as the “missing link”, it garnered huge support from evolutionists, only
later to be uncovered as a hoax. Just because a theory has support doesn’t
make it true — science has been wrong before, many times.

So matter can come from nothing? The only reason to
believe the big bang violates known physical laws is if experimental
evidence exists (that pesky scientific method again). Where is it?

The statement on nonliving material doesn’t make
much sense. I’m sure the letter writer would believe he’s alive, so
the statement doesn’t yield much insight. Evolution in brief is “From the
goo to the zoo to you”. Where is the data proving goo can become anything
but goo? What we’re talking about is billions of years ago, in some pool,
suddenly a single-cell being appeared.

Where is the evidence? No answers here either.

Again, a claim that science overwhelmingly supports evolution. But where is the data?

At least this person accepts the scientific
method. So he must understand <span class="pullquote">
without data, evolution is un-scientific.</span>
Evolution isn’t a debate; it’s not even science. It survives as its
followers blindly cling to its dogma, refusing to consider
experimental evidence (or lack thereof).

Conclusion
----------

The questions remain. None of these attempts address
the fundamental questions using the scientific method (to say it
another way, evolution is not scientific by definition). We’re still issuing a
simple request for scientific, repeatable, peer-reviewed experimental
data for the following (if evolution is true, *all four* must
have evidence):

-   Matter can come from nothing.
-   Non-living material can become alive.
-   Explosions produce order.
-   Species can change into another.

If we assume a scientific basis for evolution, repeatable scientific
experiments must exist for these assumptions. You cannot
claim parts of the theory (which violate known scientific laws) “just
happened” without experimental data.

In order to enter in to this discussion, you must
have an open mind, and examine the data on a scientific basis only.
To perform that task, you must throw off the existing evolutionary dogma and begin your quest
for scientific data on its merits alone. Evolutionary supporters claim
overwhelming evidence for the theory, but seldom desire to
scientifically cite it.

Straw men and personal attacks have no place in science. Unless you have nothing scientific to say.

It’s about science and experimental data.
