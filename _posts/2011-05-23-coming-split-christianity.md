We’ve talked before about the coming church division,
but it’s interesting even liberal progressive “Christians” have come to
the conclusion a split will soon come.

<blockquote cite="http://www.redletterchristians.org/digging-deeper-the-coming-evangelical-split/">
<p>I believe we’ll eventually find two basic coalitions: Traditional Evangelicals and Progressive Evangelicals.&nbsp;… </p>

He goes on to state how each group views the Bible:

-   Traditional — The Bible is the inspired, inerrant, authoritative
    Word of God.
-   Liberal — Christianity is a “lifestyle”, with the Bible of less
    importance. Thus, social justice becomes more important than the
    Bible (which makes since, since social justice isn’t *in* the Bible,
    you’ll have to minimize the Bible if you’re for social justice), or
    as the author said “the emphasis is more on growth thru the process
    of work and serving others” — also known as the heresy of the church and the common good.

Notice the liberal view of Christianity is nothing more than the old
philosophy of value relativism, where everyone does what is right in
their own eyes and absolute authority doesn’t exist — that may be truth
for *you*, but not for *me* — and the Bible no longer holds the place
of authority.

Of course, truth is truth, whether you accept it or not, like it or not,
or believe it or not.

Progressive “Christians” absorb godless philosophy, agreeing with
Richard Dawkins as he said no absolutes exist,
and morality comes from popular opinion,
not absolute truth. Liberals repackage godless philosophy (whether they
realize it or not), wrapping it with a thin candy shell of religion
hiding the toxic poison inside; it’s not wise for the church to adopt techniques from someone admiring satan and rebellion.

You must choose a position — will you choose the absolute truth of the
Bible, or will you minimize it to accept man’s godless philosophy of
value relativism (even if wrapped in religious terms) where the Bible
is minimized?

It’s time to decide what you believe and make a stand … because it’s
2:59AM and even those reducing the importance of the Bible realize a
split into traditional Christianity and liberal “Christianity” espousing
heresies like social justice, common good, and collective salvation will
soon be upon us.
