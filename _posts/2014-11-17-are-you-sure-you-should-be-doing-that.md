People wonder, why train in Taekwondo? I’m a big fan of old cartoons,
specifically Coyote and Roadrunner. On one episode a few kids sat in
front of a TV, and one asked the other, why does the Coyote even want
the Road Runner?

Wile E. Coyote stopped, responding “a legitimate question, one deserving
a legitimate answer.” As I complete my second degree black belt, people
wonder, why do you do it?

What does Taekwondo mean?
-------------------------

It means I’m proud of my family. They’ve stuck with it in spite of
adversity. Peggy earned her black belt, and Waylon earned his
third-degree belt. I’m proud of them both beyond description.

Everyone wants to quit sometimes. Everyone. I’ve yet to meet an
exception — adult or child. Life is hard, and the best things in life
take hard work, or in the words of President Kennedy:

> We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things,
> not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that
> goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and
> skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept,
> one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win…

When he delivered that speech the idea of the United States making it to
the moon was absurd; our rockets blew up on launch or soon thereafter.
The thought the United States could land a man on the moon in less than
10 years was absurd. Laughable. Go ahead, Google old YouTube video from
the launch failures.

Yet, after Kennedy made that announcement, we *did* put together the
most stunning engineering achievement in mankind’s history. Fail, yes.
Setbacks to be sure. Multiple times people wondered, why are we doing
this? Is it worth it? We do it not because it is easy, but because it is
hard.

Life is hard. You may not get a Lexus, an ice cream, or a pony.

What does Taekwondo mean?
-------------------------

Most people fail not because they can’t do it, but because they’d rather
play XBox than practice. That’s a choice, not a limitation.

I’ve never been a good athlete, and I’m certainly nowhere near the best
in any category, and never will be.

I just try harder. And that doesn’t mean everyone else is a flake, it
means I *HAVE* to. Others learn new skills in a few minutes, and
certainly need to practice, but they get it. That’s not me.

Waylon laughs at me. A lot. And hard. We attended an MMA seminar taught
by Colby Covington, learning some new takedowns, and when trying it out,
I kept saying, let me try again, I’m not getting it. He finally
complained, it’s my turn, you’ve done enough, and I said, you got it the
first time through.

He just laughed, grinned with a face that is seared into my subconscious
so even if I develop the worst case of Alzheimer’s in the planet’s
history, laying on my deathbed drooling all over myself, I’ll still see
that image.

He said, yeah, I did, let me help you old man.

I’ve spent literally *months* trying to learn Taekwondo moves, leading
to aggravation, failure, and a general feeling of doom. But what we get
too easily we esteem too lightly. Life is hard. You might not get a
Lexus, an ice cream, or a pony.

Good things in life demand hard work and effort, as Zig Ziglar says,
“There are no traffic jams on the extra mile,” an attitude summed up by
actor [Will Smith](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doqS35FfcUE).

It means for the last year every time I tie my belt I can’t help but
grin. It’s hard, and that is what makes it worth having because only a
small percentage of people beginning training make it — not because they
can’t, but because they fail to stick with it.

The difference isn’t always physical, talent, or even hard work. It’s a
choice some people make to avoid the effort required to acquire their
goal.

I’m in a select group, and tying that belt never gets old. Everything
else can be taken away, but I’ll never forget performing over and beyond
what I believed I’m capable of accomplishing.

It means going to the emergency room, and seeing the same doctor who
remembers you, who asks again, are you sure you should be doing this?

And thinking to yourself, yeah, probably not. But I can’t quit, so
patch it up doc, and I’m good to go.

You probably never heard the name Guilder Rodriguez, unless you’re a
Texas Rangers fan. He started his major league career 0 for 6. Do you
think he wanted to quit? Wonder if he could make it? Do I really belong
here? In one game he got two hits, helping win the game for Texas.

Oh yeah, one more thing. He’s an old guy at 31, and played 1,095 games
in the minors over 13 years before being called up to the majors.

How many times did he want to quit?

How many times do *I* want to quit? Let me count the ways…

* Every time I watch everyone learn something in 10 minutes, and I
    take the next 3 weeks to figure it out.
* Every time we grapple and I spend the next days exceeding the
    recommend dose of ibuprofen.
* Every time we spar, and my brain sees what’s coming, tells my leg to
    move, and then I watch in slow motion as what seems like minutes
    pass before that leg moves.

I’m certainly not alone being an old guy trying to hold out in a
youth-dominated area. It’s frustrating, but you only get better by
training with the best — faster, stronger, smarter.

Training with stronger, faster, younger people than myself, I’m better
than I would be otherwise. And oh yeah, if anyone needs help with
Quantum Physics, I have an edge.

Maybe it’s Chase Lambin, another guy you’ve never heard of. He’s the
oldest active minor league player at 34 who has *never* made it to the
big leagues. For some reason, he keeps going.

<blockquote cite="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/nationals/chase-lambin-a-minor-league-baseball-player-at-34-holds-on-to-mlb-dream/2013/07/14/72bfcce8-e977-11e2-a301-ea5a8116d211_story.html">
<p>Teammates respected Lambin because of his longevity, and now he was showing youngsters how to swing and deal with the daily grind. They would get promoted sometimes, and while Lambin used to watch the highlights and wonder why it wasn’t him, now he was happy that maybe he’d had a hand in someone else’s success.</p>

<p>“These young guys need to be motivated and helped,” he said, “and I really enjoy that side.”</p>
</blockquote>

There’s something I relate to. I’ll never be the best, the fastest, the
winningest, or make it to the big leagues. But I do have (*ahem*) a bit
more, umm, shall we say, *experience*, than everyone else.

What we get too easily we esteem too lightly. Life is hard. You might
not get a Lexus, an ice cream, or a pony.

What Does Taekwondo Mean?

I’ve been asked why, as a Christian, would I compete in martial arts?
Aren’t they icky, evil, and wrong for a Christian to be involved with?
What happened to turning the other cheek? Wasn’t Jesus a pacifist?

Only if your idea of Jesus comes from those phony paintings you see on
church walls. Jesus isn’t a wimp. Never was, never will be.

> Praise the LORD, who is my rock. He trains my hands for war and gives
> my fingers skill for battle. (Psalm 144 NLT)

If you imagine a wimpy Jesus, then you might think it’s strange for
Christians to train in martial arts.

A wimp? Tell that to the money changers.

A wimp? After being beaten and whipped, He *still* carried a massive
wooden beam.

A wimp? Hanging on the cross, He could have jumped off any time He
wanted. That’s toughness.

I’ve seen people with more talent in martial arts than I can be imagine.
It’s a gift from God, and God don’t make no junk.

What does Taekwondo mean?
-------------------------

I’ve always told Waylon I’m not so interested in winning or losing —
though that’s nice. But if he walks off the mat and says that’s all I’ve
got, I’m happy. If he wins but slacks off, it means nothing.

> Success is not measured by what you do compared to what others do, it
> is measured by what you do with the ability God gave you. — Zig Ziglar

I hope I’m doing okay by that measure. That’s the measuring stick, not a
won-loss record.

Because unless you’re a professional or olympian, Taekwondo by itself
doesn’t mean much, but it prepares you for when you *will* need
perseverance, when you *will* be challenged beyond what you think you
can do, when you *will* question your ability, your desire, and even
your sanity.

* When your boss tells you you’ve got to do something you’ve never
    done before — in the next 10 minutes.
* When the doctor says it’s cancer, and you think it’s just another
    chance to kick some butt.
* When you’ve made a commitment and you really want out, but my word
    is my bond.

That’s when you pull out your memory file, and think, yeah, I remember
when I didn’t think I could do that tornado round kick, and I did that,
so *this* is within my grasp — and that’s what gets you through tough
times.

In spite of politicians lying to us, Hollywood actors being arrested,
and sports figures proudly proclaiming they’re not role models, I’m
reminded *character matters.*

> You work hard and suffer because it makes you a better man. If the
> rewards you seek are found in the praise and adulation of others, you
> are destined for disappointment, because the moment you drop one pass,
> or lose one game, the cheering stops and the praise goes away.
> Internal rewards, the ones you gain from pain, sweat, and tears, stick
> with you forever. (Lou Holtz, “Wins, Losses, and Lessons” page 78–79)

It’s about finding your limits keep moving just a bit further. What you
thought you couldn’t do is now doable.

What would you do today if you *knew* you couldn’t fail?

As Zig Ziglar says, failure is an event, not a person. You never drown
by falling in water. You only drown by not getting up. You *will* fail,
you *will* face hard times, you *will* want to give up. Guaranteed.

Life isn’t easy, and you may not get a Lexus, an ice cream, or a pony.

Never quit. Never give in. Never surrender. Make no mistake, you’ll want
to. The difference between the best and others isn’t talent, effort, or
even hard work. It’s the mental toughness to say I’ll never quit.

<blockquote cite="http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2004/08/14/learn-goal-setting-from-the-olympics/">
<p>Having finished 17th at beach volleyball nationals, I can tell you that the difference between the very top and those near the top is not skills — everyone has the skills. The difference is mental. Players in the top five or ten are so tough that almost nothing makes them waver, and their belief in their ability to succeed is extreme.</p>
</blockquote>

What we get too easily we esteem too lightly. Life is hard. You might
not get a Lexus, an ice cream, or a pony.

What does Taekwondo mean?
-------------------------

I’ve seen kids in tournaments fail and come to tears. Maybe they were
embarrassed by their lack of success. Maybe they thought (or heard)
people laughing at them when they fell down, dropped their weapon,
failed at the board break, or forgot their form.

Let them laugh, in the end only a small group of people exists whose
opinion is worth listening to. The mockers butt isn’t out on the mat.

> It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the
> strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them

> no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive
> to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who
> spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the
> triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at
> least fails while daring greatly… (Theodore Roosevelt)

The reality is people will laugh. Let ‘em. They’re not out on the mat
trying. Being a critic and couch potato is easy. Getting off the couch
and on the floor is risky, and not for those lacking vision and guts.

It means Sunday, November 16th will remain a special day forever. It’s
the only time the kid and I will test for black-belt together, and
there’s an appropriate story about that.

<blockquote cite="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/06/15/bittersweet-day-got-hit-off-dad-best-fastball/">
<p>I am a grown and graying man of forty, sweating in the April sun. My son stands away from me and taps his bat on the Frisbee he calls home plate. We’ve been in the backyard for an hour, head down/weight back/elbow up/see the ball. He’s sent a dozen tennis balls out over the creek, more onto the roof of our house. Twice, he’s swung late and peppered the neighbor’s shed.</p>
<p>But now it’s time for the last pitch. Smoke, I call it—fast and hard, like a blur.</p>
<p>He’s never hit a last pitch, can’t even get the bat off his shoulder. But he says he’s ready and I wind and that blur rockets from my hand, and I don’t hear the whoosh of his bat. I hear a plink!</p>
<p>We look up to see the ball flying into the blue sky. It lands in the thick grass over behind me. I hear my son whooping, overcome with joy … Part of me sees this and is proud. The other part sees that yellow ball lying in the green grass and knows that was my best, that was as hard as I could throw. That was my smoke. And by the time my son finishes his lap, I think he knows it, too.</p>
</blockquote>

Well, junior can hit the old man’s smoke. I think he’s known for a
while, but been polite about it. I am at the same time both proud, and
with a feeling I can’t exactly describe.

Back when he was four or so, we were in the backyard kicking a soccer
ball around. He wasn’t very good, and even on the few times he made
contact with the ball, it didn’t go very far.

Once I hit it the ball a little hard, and the ball flew to the other
side of the yard. We don’t have a big yard by any standards (so it was
no great athletic achievement), so even though the ball only went fifty
or sixty feet, he was in awe, because I could do something he couldn’t
even dream of.

You always want your kids to look up to you and be amazed. But when they
surpass you, that magic, that sense of awe, vaporizes, like Dorthy
pulling back the curtain on the wizard frantically pulling levels and
switches trying to maintain the illusion.

He’ll continue to get faster, stronger, and better, and thus the sense
of awesomeness fades slowly away since he’s peeked behind the curtain,
seeing the old man is just an ordinary guy, not the superman he thought
eleven years ago.

Besides my wife, he’s the guy I don’t want to let down or embarrass.

… And that’s why I keep going, after all, my emergency room frequent
visitor card is almost full, so the next broken bone is free.
