Perhaps after [losing salvation]({% post_url 2008-01-01-can-you-lose-your-salvation %})
one of the more heated discussion involves Calvinism and Arminianism, or
simply predestination versus free will — did God choose me or did I
choose Him?

Churches split over this issue, and that’s sad. Each side offers their
proof, but both are right… and wrong as well. Here’s one verse cited:

> All that the Father giveth me shall come to me (John 6:37)

AH HA! Proof text. It’s Calvinism! God chose and you have no choice! Of
course, Jesus continues:

> … and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.

AH HA! Proof text. It’s Arminianism! It’s your free-will choice!

Oh wait, Calvinism and Arminianism are *both* in *one* verse (one
sentence even). Ooops. Tilt.

The Calvinism and Arminianism debate stems from a lack of understanding
of Einstein’s Relativity. It’s simply a matter of [Frame of Reference]({% post_url 2009-01-01-frames-reference %}).
If you understand Einstein’s relativity (it’s not really that hard, see
the previous link), you’ll quickly notice the predestination versus free
will debate simply views the same event from two different
reference frames.

Both are right in what they assert, both are wrong denying the truth.
