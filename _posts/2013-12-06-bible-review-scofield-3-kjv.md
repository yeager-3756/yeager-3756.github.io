The best Bible you can have is a 1967 Scofield
Bible for all the reasons I’ve discussed in my primer on Bible Translation.
It’s Textus-Receptus based, ignoring the corrupt Westcott-Hort (also
known as UBS or Nestle-Aland) text. Sadly, it seems to go in and out of
print, so what should a discerning Bible student use?

Since the 1967 Scofield isn’t always available, I obtained a Scofield
III KJV ([ISBN 978-0-19-527850-7](http://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-scofield-study-bible-iii-kjv-9780195278507))
to see if it’s as good as its predecessor. It’s typeset in an easy-to-read style, with nice margins.


The 1967 makes word changes directly in the text, making it quite easy
to read, while clarifying words with changed meaning since 1611. It’s
easiest to show this with an example, using 1 Thessalonians 4:15. First,
the 1967 Scofield:

<p><img class="centered border" src="/images/blog/67scofield.jpg" width="350" height="245" /></p>

The Greek for precede (φθάνω phthanō) means come before. Notice vertical
bars around *precede* notify you of a language change (with the original
word in the margin) — *prevent* has been changed to *precede*, which is
accurate.

But notice the way it appears in the Scofield III:

<p><img class="centered border" src="/images/blog/scofield3.jpg" width="350" height="284" /></p>

The 1967 and the Scofield III are reverse — the 1967 makes word changes
in the text, while the current Scofield III has them in the margins.

For those unfamiliar with Olde English, the 1967 is easier to
understand, which is why it’s my primary reading and teaching Bible.

When it’s unavailable, the Scofield III is the next best, and *far*
superior to the alphabet soup of the modern, corrupt, translations all based on the Alexandrian
Westcott-Hort base (also known as UBS or Nestle-Aland).

If you don’t like the KJV, get a good New King James Bible (NKJV) and
it’s almost as good as the KJV. KJV-Only purists won’t be happy, but
people on both extremes are *never* happy with my stance on Bible
Translations.

The best Bible you can have, in order of most preferred to least:

1.  1967 Scofield KJV
2.  Scofield III KJV
3.  Other KJV Study Bibles
4.  NKJV
5.  NASB

The first four are nearly equal, while the NASB falls off a bit as it
uses some of Westcott-Hort’s perversions of the text, but doesn’t follow
*all* of them as other recent translations do — compare Matthew 18:11 in
the NIV, KJV, and NASB, for example.

Please remember notes appearing in your Bible are *not* inspired by God,
they’re no better than any other commentary you might pick up. Many
times a note appears at the end of Mark claiming the last few verses
don’t appear in some manuscripts (the corrupt ones). Just ignore it.

The Scofield KJV Bibles aren’t the best because of the study notes,
they’re the best due to the Bible text itself. I’ve had people complain
about some of the notes in Scofields, and do not recommend it because of
notes, rather it’s the KJV text and how it’s handled.

For some strange reason, the publisher doesn’t keep the 1967 Scofield in
print, in spite of demand — I’ve seen them offered for over $300 on
Amazon. I’ve asked for a reason from the publisher, but have never
received a response.

When the 1967 Scofield KJV is in print, it’s the best choice, and
remains the best KJV Bible.

When unavailable, the Scofield III KJV is the next best thing.
