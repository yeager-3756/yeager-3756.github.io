To understand the danger of replacement theology, we need to get a firm
grasp on what it is. Unfortunately, many people provide different
definitions, from a subtle error, all the way to hostile
anti-Semitic ideas.

**Replacement theology proposes the church has in some way replaced
Israel**.

However, once that foundation is laid, various proponents of replacement
theology differ in how far they’ll go. The milder versions claim Israel
which today exists isn’t really the Israel of God’s plan, and the church
now enjoys the promises God made to the Jews, while the “real” Jews will
make an appearance later.

More extreme views declare God has cast off the Jews, and Israel has no
special treatment from God any more; the church *is* now Israel, and
when the New Testament refers to the Jews (Revelation), you can
allegorize that to the church.

It could be **popular to use replacement theology to meld the church
with the world** (not a good idea), since if Israel isn’t really God’s
people anymore you can join the popular notion Israel is the source of
all the problems, and if they would just go away, the Middle East (and
the world) would live happily ever after.

Of course, **replacement theology is all nonsense**, whether it’s the
mild form, or the extreme anti-Semite form. God’s covenant with Abraham
in Genesis 15 was unconditional and unilateral (“In the same day the
LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this
land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river
Euphrates”). If you study Genesis 15 carefully and note the historical
background, you’ll quickly discover the covenant with Abram was
unilateral by God alone, and only He can break it.

So if replacement theology has *any* credibility, the first issue must
be **where did God break the Abrahamic covenant?**

Ezekiel may also contain explicitly fulfilled prophecies declaring when
the Jews would be back in the land, and regain Jerusalem. If that be so,
**those proposing the Jewish people inhabiting Israel currently aren’t
really “spiritual” Jews have a lot of explaining to do**.

In the end, replacement theology proponents must be able to answer a few
questions for their ideas to be taken seriously:

1.  Where and when did God retract the unconditional promises made
    to Israel?
2.  In light of Ezekiel 4, how can modern Israel *not* be Israel?
3.  If you reject the Ezekiel 4 prophecy, why would God allow “impostor”
    Jews to inhabit His land? How do you *know* they’re not the “real”
    Israel? Who gets to decide what Jews qualify, and what Jews don’t?

The church and the Jews are distinct groups with different origins and
destinies. Attempting to mingle the two creates hopeless problems,
resulting in proclaiming some Bible passages don’t mean what they
clearly state. Who gets to decide what gets allegorized and what
is literal?

The more you study, the more problems replacement theology causes. At
best it’s misleading and wrong, causing problems in prophetic studies,
while at worst it’s heretical and anti-Semitic.
