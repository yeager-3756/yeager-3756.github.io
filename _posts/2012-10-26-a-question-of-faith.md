In the midst of trials, people might wonder where God is. After all,
we've been praying, where is God? Is my faith not sufficient? Am I not
doing it right? Is something else wrong? Perhaps nothing is wrong — the
answer comes from Paul’s letter to the Romans, so hang on a bit for the
answer.

Paul had to deal with a big question — was it okay to eat meat
sacrificed to idols? Some said no since the meat was involved in pagan
rituals, others thought nothing of it. Who was (is) right?

Paul laid the groundwork for the question in his instruction to the
Corinthians.

> As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in
> sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world,
> and that there is none other God but one … But meat commendeth us not
> to God; for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat
> not, are we the worse. (1 Corinthians 8)

An idol is nothing more than a chunk of wood. Eating meat sacrificed to
a phony idol therefore, has no power, and really makes no difference.
Yet some made a big deal about it, and they instructed others to be
strong, and not eat of it, while the weak Christians couldn’t hold
themselves to the purer standard.

Paul flips that around.

It’s the *weak* in faith brother who refrains from eating — the stronger
in faith understands nothing is wrong with the hunk of meat, as an idol
is nothing.

Okay, stay with me, what can this *possibly* have to do with Christians
suffering horrible trials?

It just could be (maybe), those who pray and pray and request for
deliverance, those *not* being healed might just be the stronger in
faith, and the Lord has some reason to allow the situation to continue,
perhaps as inspiration for others.

Can this be true? I’m certainly not sure, but as exhibit “A” I present
the apostle Paul, who prayed three times for his condition to be
removed.

> And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength
> is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory

Raise your hand if you think Paul lacked faith or devotion to be healed.
Yeah, me neither.

So we have at least *one* situation where a giant of faith wasn’t
healed, and the Lord specifically informed Paul it wasn’t going to
happen.

If you’re in trials, sure, you should ask the Lord for intervention. But
if nothing happens, consider the *possibility* the Lord considers your
shoulders broad enough to handle the burden. I’m reminded of what the
late great Earnhardt said after one race in Daytona about another
driver.

<blockquote cite="http://www.nascar.com/news/110210/2001-daytona-500-memories-10/index.html">
<p>“Early in the qualifier, Dale got into the back of me and got me all sideways up through the middle of Turns 3 and 4,” Houston said. “I thought I was gonna crash. I mean, I was way out of control. Well, when we got down there for pre-race for the 500, he come up and grabbed me around the neck like he always does and kinda squeezes you half to&nbsp;death.</p>

<p>“He said, ’You were bad out of shape in that qualifying race, wasn’t you?!?’ I said, ’Yeah, because you had my back wheels off the ground.’ He kind of snickered a little bit, and said, ’<b>Yeah … I knew you could handle&nbsp;it.’…</b></p>
</blockquote>

Perhaps, just perhaps, you’re stuck in a trial because while you think
you’re sideways and bad out of shape the Master says “I know you can
handle it.” After all, consider Job. (Note to self: remind the Lord
*never* to brag about me)
