Many issues divide the Body of Christ today. Baptism, communion,
pre-tribulation rapture verses post-tribulation and more all cause
division in the Church as satan loves to divide and conquer; it’s sad we fight
among ourselves instead of the real enemy.

One of satan’s strategies from early in Genesis becomes casting
doubt on God’s word. Recall in the garden satan’s words “Has God
really said?” confusing Eve and causing her to sin. Satan realizes casting
doubt on what God actually says can be a winning strategy for him — what
could cause more confusion than casting doubt the Bible in your lap
isn’t the exact Word of God?

</div>

This strategy continues today with the Bible translation debate. Is the
King James really the best translation? What about the old language?
Shouldn’t newer translations be used? As usual many views exist, and
unfortunately some people involved become rather militant. We’ve been
told if you’re witnessing to someone and they become saved, but you didn’t
use King James Version it didn’t count. That’s absurd.

However, in view of satan’s strategy of creating doubt in God’s word
the translation and preservation of the Bible becomes critically important;
you can’t dismiss the concept and use whatever translation you pick off
the shelf. Balance is required; getting that balance requires effort on
your part — you need to do some homework. Fortunately acquiring a basic
familiarity with the issues can be done briefly, paying dividends in
your Bible Study.

Anyone translating between languages quickly understands one
thing, it’s *impossible* to completely and accurately translate
between languages. The translator must always choose different wording
to convey the original idea; sometimes it’s impossible to express the idea
of one language in another. As such, the original always surpasses the
copy for accuracy; translation forces a compromise of sorts, subject to
the personal ideas of the translator (which explains why we must
understand the personal ideas of the translator).

The idea a *perfect* translation exists quickly
disappears — they *all* have problems; understanding which
translations have which problems is important. In the following
discussion, we’ll take a brief and summary look at issues affecting translation,
and how those issues impact the various translations. You must understand
these issues to understand the advantages and disadvantages of the
translation in your lap.

Issues Affecting Translation
----------------------------

When considering Bible translation, many issues arise but for
simplicity we’ll stick to two; these main issues concern you as a Christian trying
to understand the Bible translation debate.

1.  What you’re translating *from*. Two main lines of Greek texts
    exist with differences between them (section 2.1). You also must
    consider if what we have today was handed down to us faithfully
    accurate to the originals (section 2.1.1).
2.  *How* you translate what you’ve got. In other words, do you
    attempt to translate literally, or use more paraphrasing? We’ll
    cover this in section 2.2.

### Textual Issues

#### Preservation of the Bible

Written 2,000 years ago, do we have correct and accurate copies of the
original New Testament? A quick glance of the following chart (Eastman
and Missler “The Bible: An Extraterrestrial Message” page 10)
illustrates the accuracy of the New Testament passed down to us, compared to other ancient writings.

<div class='table-wrapper'>

</div>

If we don’t accept the validity and accuracy of the Bible, we must
throw out much more than the Bible. Do we doubt writings with considerably
less sources? The existence of George Washington? With considerable
manuscript evidence, the Bible stands apart from other ancient writings.

> Norman Geisler, a world renowned Bible scholar echoed this when
>  he states: “Only 400 words of the NT are in doubt, whereas 764 lines
> of the Iliad are questioned. This five percent textual corruption (in
> the Iliad) compares with one-half of one percent of similar emendations
> in the New Testament” (Eastman and Missler “The Bible: An Extraterrestrial Message” page 11-12)

So the Bible has been preserved through the centuries for us as
originally written; we can be confident of the accuracy of our copies
as many of the differences exist in spelling or other minor issues.

#### Textual History

Two main lines of Greek texts exist, diverging in minor but important
ways. The text used almost exclusively until the 1800’s was Textus
Receptus. However, manuscript discoveries in Alexandria changed some
scholars views. But are those manuscripts reliable?

In 1525, Erasmus compiled the first Greek text using texts from
Byzantium, which had been in use previously for centuries, forming the
basis for what would later be called Textus Receptus (Chuck Missler,
“How we got our Bible”, page 17-18), and the main text the KJV
translators used. Although they had the other Alexandrian texts available (Codex
Siniaticus, etc), they obviously felt the Alexandrian text base (later to become
Westcott-Hort) was unsuitable.

Westcott and Hort compiled a Greek New Testament starting in 1853 and
finished 28 years later, relying heavily on the Alexandrian Codex
Vaticanus and Codex Siniaticus, changing the traditional Greek in over 8,000
places (Chuck Missler, “How we got our Bible”, page 18). We’ll treat
all these Alexandrian texts similarly and refer to them collectively as
Westcott-Hort (not technically correct, but for our purposes it’s
close enough). How they edited the text, the reasons why and their
background becomes critical to understanding the newer translations derived from
Westcott-Hort’s work.

Only two modern translations use the Textus Receptus Greek text (KJV,
NKJV); all the others (NASB, NIV, etc) use Westcott-Hort or
Alexandrian texts. After studying these a bit (which we’ll get to), it
becomes apparent they’ve all been edited for theological reasons; the
influence of early Gnostic heresy runs through Westcott-Hort’s text.

For ease of discussion we’re grouping various families of texts, which
although not entirely accurate, proves sufficient for our purposes. For
our uses, Byzantine, Textus Receptus and the Majority Text will be treated
as equivalent, and simply called Textus Receptus, while Westcott-Hort,
UBS, and Nestle-Aland will be treated as the Alexandrian line and referred
to as Westcott and Hort or Alexandrian.

#### Gnostic Influence — Westcott and Hort

Early in church history a heretical group sprang up called the
Gnostics, accepting the Greek idea of dualism between spirit and matter (“Nelsons
New Illustrated Bible Dictionary” page 500). All matter in Gnostic
teaching was evil; since all matter is evil, Jesus really didn’t have a
physical body and no physical resurrection occurred. The Gnostics also believed
they had special knowledge, leading to spiritual elitism in the
early church.

The Gnostic’s teaching on the evilness of material leads to two errors.
On one side was a form of asceticism — the path to heaven comes by
denying yourself (the extreme puritanical view). On the other side,
your body (since it is evil) doesn’t matter. If you use drugs or party it
really doesn’t matter since your body is evil anyway.

The Gnostic heresy Jesus didn’t have a body denies His death, physical
resurrection, and thus His atonement for our sins. The apostle John
wrote his first letter (1 John) in part to combat Gnostic heresy. John
writes he saw and handled Jesus — Jesus had a physical body. Even
more, John warned anyone stating Jesus did not come *in the flesh*
is not of God.

> Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth
> that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: And every spirit
> that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God:
> and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it
> should come; and even now already is it in the world. (1 John 4:2–3 KJV)

John’s one statement debunks all of Gnostic heresy. Why then is
academia so enamored by it? Why would Westcott-Hort follow such heresy when it
so  obviously contradicts Biblical teaching? Why have we allowed people
who obviously rejected Biblical teaching to edit God’s Word?

Westcott and Hort edited the original Greek as they compiled their
edition, but as we shall see, Gnostic philosophy heavily influenced
both men. The Greek texts they used appear footnoted in your Bible as “the
oldest and best manuscripts”. Yes, they’re the oldest, but are they
the best? Westcott and Hort held strange theological views — do we trust
them with God’s Word? Consider the words of Westcott and
Hort themselves.

> But the book which has engaged me most is Darwin … My feeling
>  is strong that the theory is unanswerable. (F.J. Hort, “Life of
> Hort”, Vol I, page 416 (Chuck Missler, “How we got our Bible”, page 19))
>
> No one now I suppose holds that the first three chapters of
>  Genesis, for example, give a literal history—I could never understand
> how  anyone reading them with open eyes could think they did. (“Life of
> Westcott”, Vol II, page 69 (Chuck Missler, “How we got our Bible”, page 19))
>
> Christians are themselves in a true sense “Christs”. (B.F. Westcott,
> “The Epistles of St. John” page 73 (Chuck Missler, “How we got our Bible”, page 19))
>
> I am inclined to think that no such state as Eden (I mean the
>  popular notion) ever existed, and that Adam’s fall in no degree
> differed from the fall of each of his descendants. (F.J.A. Hort, “Life of
> Hort”, Vol I, page 78 (Chuck Missler, “How we got our Bible”, page 19)

These are their views. They’re entitled to them, of course, but do they
agree with your Bible reading? In light of John’s warning about
Gnostic heresy, can we trust these men to compile an accurate Greek text? As
we’ll see in the examples, they allowed their un-orthodox views to influence
their compilation of the Holy Scriptures — in some ways that simply
make no sense.

The Bible must be considered an integrated message to be used as whole
and complete. As soon as editing begins, contradictions and other
problems arise, as we’ll see in the examples section. No way exists for
Westcott-Hort (or anyone else) to edit the Biblical text and keep it consistent.

Go back and re-read the previous paragraph and make sure it sinks in.
If the Bible is the inspired, inerrant Word of God, any internal
inconsistencies in a manuscript cause the rejection of that manuscript.
No need to spend hours in the library on archaeological and historical
records, if the manuscript contains internal errors it must
be rejected.

### Translational Issues

Once you decide on the textual base (Textus Receptus or Westcott-Hort),
you must decide exactly how to translate — literal or paraphrase?
Both have pros and cons, but mostly you want to know where on the
scale your translation lies. If you’ve ever picked up a Greek-English
interlinear you know it can be difficult to read, as this
example shows.

> so For loved God the world, so as the Son of Him, the
>  Only-begotten, He gave, that everyone believing into Him not may
> perish,  but have life everlasting. (John 3:16 Interlinear Greek-English NT,
> 3rd  Edition, Jay P. Green)

So the question isn’t quite literal vs. paraphrase, but how much
paraphrasing does the translator perform? A translator trying to
remain literal will do the minimum required to put the sentence into
grammatically correct English and no more, while a paraphrase tries to convey the
*idea* of the original without using the exact wording of the
original and may take into account cultural or other differences.

Weights and measures provide one easy example. How many people know
what a cubit is? Or that 4 cubits make one fathom? Or 1 firkin is about 9
gallons? In a literal translation, these quantities translate as-is,
and it’s up to you to understand what they are. In more of a paraphrase
translation, these appear in modern measures.

It’s easiest to show this issue with examples, so we’ll move right
to it.

### Examples

#### Literal vs Paraphrase

Consider 2 Timothy 2:15 in two translations and examine how the
literal verses paraphrase problem presents itself.

> Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth
>  not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. (KJV)

“Rightly divide” translates the Greek word orthotomeo (from
orthos) — you might recognize as similar to the math term orthogonal
meaning a right angle. So the KJV is literal. But do you know what it
means? If you have a math background you understand orthogonal as
precise, an exact right angle, as the KJV accurately and literally translates
the Greek. Now consider the NIV.

> Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a
>  workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the
> word of truth (NIV)

“Correctly handles” is not literal, but for many people brings the
truth of the verse out better. But notice instead of “Study” the NIV
uses “Do your best” which completely changes the meaning making it less
clear. Study implies dedication or devotion, while just doing your best can
mean a lot less. John chapter seven provides another example.

> His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into
>  Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.
> For  there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself
> seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, show thyself to the world.
> (John 7:3–4 KJV)

You might miss Jesus’ brothers picking on Him a little; since they
didn’t believe Jesus was God, they’re actually baiting Him to show His
stuff. Now compare the New Living Translation.

> Jesus’ brothers urged him to go to Judea for the celebration.
>  “Go where your followers can see your miracles!” they scoffed. “You
>  can’t become a public figure if you hide like this! If you can do
> such  wonderful things, prove it to the world!” (John 7:3–4 NLT)

In these two examples you can see both the advantages and disadvantages
of literal and paraphrase translation. Most of the time literal
translation proves the most beneficial, but sometimes referring to a paraphrase
proves advantageous.

#### Textual

For these, we’re using KJV and NKJV as examples of Textus Receptus, and
as a representative of Westcott-Hort, the NIV (and also the NASB or the
New American Standard Bible). Westcott-Hort influence most “modern”
translations, even if they don’t follow exactly the full changes
Westcott-Hort made (NIV more, NASB less). Some translations include
the changes in footnotes, others include in the main text.

> (Matthew 18:11 NKJV) For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost.
>
> (Matthew 18:11 KJV) For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.
>
> (Matthew 18:11 NIV) ***deleted***

NIV deletes entirely, while NASB brackets it as probably not in
original text. Why delete this verse? Perhaps if you believe (as Westcott) we’re
all true Christs and don’t have need of salvation.

> (Matthew 25:13 NKJV) Watch therefore, for you know neither the
>  day nor the hour in which ***the Son of Man is
>  coming***.
>
> (Matthew 25:13 KJV) Watch therefore, for ye know neither the
>  day nor the hour wherein ***the Son of man cometh***.
>
> (Matthew 25:13 NIV) Therefore keep watch, because you do not
>  know the day or the hour.

That’s a bizarre one. Why would I keep watch if I don’t know what time
it was? But it’s not the time, it’s the time of Jesus’ return you
don’t know. Jesus taught to always be on the lookout for His return — it
can come anytime.

> (Mark 2:17 NKJV) When Jesus heard it, He said to them, “Those
>  who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I
> did not  come to call the righteous, but sinners, ***to repentance***.”
>
> (Mark 2:17 KJV) When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They
>  that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick:
> I came not to call the righteous, but sinners ***to  repentance***.
>
> (Mark 2:17 NIV) On hearing this, Jesus said to them, “It is
>  not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to
> call the righteous, but sinners.”

Another fun one. Jesus didn’t come to call the righteous, but sinners.
For what? An invitation to dinner? To Saturday’s football game? (NASB
contains similar edit to NIV).

> (Acts 8:37 NKJV) Then Philip said, “If you believe with all
>  your heart, you may.” And he answered and said, “I believe that
> Jesus  Christ is the Son of God.”
>
> (Acts 8:37 KJV) And Philip said, If thou believest with all
>  thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that
> Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
>
> (Acts 8:37 NIV) ***deleted***

If you didn’t believe Jesus was God, you certainly wouldn’t want it in
your text so you delete it. NASB brackets as not in original text.

> (Ephesians 3:9 NKJV) and to make all see what is the fellowship
>  of the mystery, which from the beginning of the ages has been hidden
> in God  who created all things ***through Jesus Christ***;
>
> (Ephesians 3:9 KJV) And to make all men see what is the
>  fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath
> been hid in God, who created all things ***by Jesus Christ***:
>
> (Ephesians 3:9 NIV) and to make plain to everyone the
>  administration of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden
> in God, who created all things.

NIV has God creating all things, NOT Jesus — which you wouldn’t
want to say if you accept Gnostic heresy. Here Westcott-Hort directly
contradict Paul in Colossians 1:16-17 who attributes creation to Jesus.
In  Colossians 1:17, Paul even states Jesus holds the atoms of the
universe together. (NASB contains similar edit to NIV).

> (1 Peter 4:1 NKJV) Therefore, since Christ suffered
>  ***for us*** in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the
>  same mind, for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin,
>
> (1 Peter 4:1 KJV) Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered
>  ***for us*** in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with
>  the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased
> from sin;
>
> (1 Peter 4:1 NIV) Therefore, since Christ suffered in his body,
>  arm yourselves also with the same attitude, because he who has
> suffered in  his body is done with sin.

Jesus didn’t just suffer, he suffered and died *for us*. NASB
with similar edit to NIV.

> (Revelation 11:17 NKJV) saying: “We give You thanks, O Lord
>  God Almighty, The One who is and who was and ***who is to
>  come***, Because You have taken Your great power and reigned.
>
> (Revelation 11:17 KJV) Saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God
>  Almighty, which art, and wast, and ***art to come***;
>  because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned.
>
> (Revelation 11:17 NIV) saying: “We give thanks to you, Lord
>  God Almighty, the One who is and who was, because you have taken your
> great  power and have begun to reign.

Denying the return of Jesus. (NASB similar to NIV).

In these few examples, you can see how Westcott-Hort personal theology
(or lack thereof) influenced their compilation of the Greek text. Some
of  these changes contradict other areas of the Bible, while others make
no sense at all. Since the inerrant Word of God contains no errors, it
must be  Westcott-Hort making the mistakes.

King James Version
------------------

### King James Only

Some claim the KJV as the only true Bible, claiming the translators of
the KJV were divinely inspired just as Peter, Paul and John were.
Unfortunately, no basis for this exists. They claim the KJV as the
“perfect” Bible in English and put in on par with the original Greek!
But as anyone who ever translated anything soon finds, it’s *impossible*
to accurately translate one language to another. Even worse, Greek is
one of the most rich languages, with English one of the worst.

My father tells me a story of someone who was KJV-Only and said when he
finished reading another translation, he just tossed it on the coffee
table. But when he finished reading the KJV, he reverently and gently
placed it back from whence it came. That’s idolatry.

We could continue to debate the KJV-only crowd, but most people don’t
hold such a view, and as such it isn’t worth the time to continue the
discussion. Just be aware some people hold this view, and from time to
time you will encounter them.

The KJV ranks as one of the best translations, although it’s not the
only translation that has use.

### Olde English

Some would throw away the KJV due to it’s old English. Certainly that
*can* be a valid reason, but shouldn’t preclude your use of it; when
studying any technical subject (math or science), certain terminology
must be learned. The KJV is no different. Remember you’re reading text 2,000
years old from a different culture — it’s going to be different.

The first problem pops up with archaic words. Dictionaries exist if you
need help, but you’ll quickly become accustomed to the vocabulary. But
the bigger issue arises from words you *think* you know, but changed
meaning over time; unless you’re aware of them you’ll definitely have
problems reading the KJV.

> For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which
>  are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent
> them  which are asleep. (1 Thessalonians 4:15 KJV)

Any new translation translates “prevent” as “precede”; the word
prevent changed meaning between 1611 and now and if you didn’t know
this verse makes no sense.

> For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now
>  letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way. (2 Thessalonians 2:7 KJV)

“Let” changed meaning to “hinder”. Again, any recent translation
correctly translates this verse (both of these verses change in the
NKJV as well). A note for people who do like the KJV over other translations,
the New Scofield Bible (1967 edition) gives you these notations so you’ll
understand with outdated word changes made right in the text. If you’re
a KJV person, get a copy of Scofield’s 1967 edition.

The other problem with old English arises from all the thees and thous
in the KJV. However, a reason does exist for these in the text; it’s to
differentiate singular and plural. Consider the following
chart: (http://av1611.com/kjbp/articles/bacon-theethou.html)

<div class='table-wrapper'>
<table>
 <thead>
  <tr>
    <th> </th>
    <th>NOM</th>
    <th>OBJ</th>
    <th>POSS</th>
  </tr>
 </thead>
 <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>1st Singular</td>
    <td>I</td>
    <td>Me</td>
    <td>My</td>
  </tr><tr><td>1st Plural</td>
    <td>We</td>
    <td>Us</td>
    <td>Our</td>
  </tr><tr><td>2nd Singular</td>
    <td>Thou</td>
    <td>Thee</td>
    <td>Thy</td>
  </tr><tr><td>2nd Plural</td>
    <td>Ye</td>
    <td>You</td>
    <td>Your</td>
  </tr><tr><td>3rd Singular</td>
    <td>He</td>

    <td>His</td>
  </tr><tr><td>3rd Plural</td>
    <td>They</td>
    <td>Them</td>
    <td>Their</td>
  </tr></tbody>
</table>
</div>

NOM = nominative, case of the subject
OBJ = objective, case of the object of the verb
POSS = possessive, case of possessing.

Why is this important? Consider Luke 22:31–32.

> And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to
>  have you, that he may sift you as wheat: But I have prayed for thee,
> that  thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy
> brethren. (Luke 22:31–32 KJV)

Here you can easily see Satan asked for much more than Peter —
perhaps the entire group! However, Jesus prays for Peter *himself*.
The distinction easily missed in other translations (including NKJV)
the KJV makes abundantly clear (a similar situation also occurs in
Exodus 4:15).

Comparison of Translations
--------------------------

So how do we rate the various translations? The following chart
provides
a guide for modern translations, showing which textual base they follow
and
a rough guide of how literally they translate the original Greek.

<div class='table-wrapper'>

</div>

TR = Textus Receptus
WH = Westcott-Hort
Literal scale runs from 0 (a perfect literal much like a Greek-English
interlinear) to 10 (a complete paraphrase — the translator reads a
paragraph and the translates it without trying to be literal).

It’s important to know just because the newer translations are marked
as Westcott-Hort does not necessarily imply they follow *all* of
Westcott-Hort; each translation has different ways of handling it.
Some footnote, some delete, some ignore Westcott-Hort changes in some areas.

Recommendations
---------------

The preferred translation is the NKJV, useful for both teaching and
personal study. The KJV appears in the majority of writings for a
simple reason: no copyright issues (look at the first few pages of any other
translation to see a list of rules of how you can quote it).

Use the New King James for primary use, study, and reading as it comes
from the preferred Textus Receptus Greek Text. However, referring to a
New Living Paraphrase in some cases will help you with meaning. These two
translations provide a solid foundation for Bible Study.

Most importantly, understand *all* translations have problems.
It’s important to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the Bible
translation you use. In the event you’re using another translation, it
does *not* mean to throw it out or stop using it.

Conclusion
----------

You must have balance — no translation is 100% perfect, they
*all* have problems. This does not mean errors or inconsistencies
exist in the Bible, only translation can never be perfect. It’s
important to understand how your translation came to be, and what methods were
used in its creation. Most importantly, you are encouraged to study on
your own.
