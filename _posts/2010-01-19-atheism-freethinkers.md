“Freethinking” may be popular, but it’s an oxymoron as so-called
freethinkers exclude things they won’t talk about or consider (god).
Many free-thinkers are the most closed-minded people we’ve ever met —
freethinking being an oxymoron as a mind works like a parachute, it only
functions when open.

<blockquote cite="http://www.ffrf.org/nontracts/freethinker.php">
<p>A person who forms opinions about religion on the basis of reason, independently of tradition, authority, or established belief. Freethinkers include atheists, agnostics and rationalists.</p>
<p>No one can be a freethinker who demands conformity to a bible, creed, or messiah. To the freethinker, revelation and faith are invalid, and orthodoxy is no guarantee of truth.</p>
</blockquote>

That obviously causes a logical problem, and becomes an oxymoron; you
can’t think freely if you’re excluding areas of consideration. So let’s
try something else:

<blockquote cite="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/freethinker">
<p>A person who forms opinions on the basis of reason, independent of authority or tradition, esp. a person whose religious opinions differ from established belief.</p>
</blockquote>

The phrase “differ from established belief” still excludes areas of
exploration, so thus can’t be truly freethinking; let’s use the
following definition for freethinker, which passes logical muster:

> A freethinker forms opinions on the basis of reason and logic.

If we use that definition, most sane people will agree thinking for
yourself is a good thing; don’t get sucked in by group-think (notice
atheists *can’t* be free-thinkers as atheists abandon critical thinking
to hold logically absurd beliefs, and place limits on what
they’ll consider).
