An MSNBC host (Lawrence O’Donnell) caused a stir when
he proclaimed:

<blockquote cite="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42196213/ns/msnbc_tv/" title="'The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell' March 17th, 2011">
<p>“The Book of Revelation” is a work of fiction describing how a truly vicious God would bring about the end of the world.  No half-smart religious person actually believes “The Book of&nbsp;Revelation.”</p>
</blockquote>

It appears the self-proclaimed socialist doesn’t believe in the Bible
(his choice), so his opinion of Revelation isn’t surprising, and if
that’s all it represented (his opinion), it wouldn’t be worth noting.

But as we’ve noted, a coming church division
is nearly upon us, as it has become “mainstream” to substitute an alternative gospel,
disbelieve the Bible, and ridicule anyone taking the Bible as the Word
of God.

O’Donnel’s comments aren’t surprising to anyone hearing his rants. The
important idea comes in comments *about* what he said, and reinforces
the truth about the coming church division between progressive, liberal
“Christians” and orthodox Bible-believing Christianity.

<blockquote cite="http://mediamatters.org/mmtv/201103220048#1253383">
<p>His belief that Revelations is fiction is his own belief but not the view of the majority of Christians. I believe Revelations teaches what will happen when the final <span class="sic">judgement</span> comes. It may or may not be metaphoric. None of us know the answer to that. The fact O’Donnell believes his view of the teachings of the Bible is the only answer is <span class="sic">appauling</span>.</p>
</blockquote>

Note the liberal response:

<blockquote cite="http://mediamatters.org/mmtv/201103220048#1253537">
<p>Only about ¹/₅ of this country’s Christians share your beliefs and a very, very small percentage of the world’s Christians share them. These beliefs are primarily American in nature and have only been around for about the last 200 years. I might add that I have many friends who are Bible professors at our local Baptist university (I go to church with them) … NONE of them share nor teach your&nbsp;beliefs.</p>
<p>… Further, most serious theologians believe that it was simply written about events which had ALREADY occurred and is not prophetical at&nbsp;all.</p>
</blockquote>


First off, this liberal poster commits several logical errors:

-   Argument from majority — “Only ¹/₅ share your beliefs”. Of course,
    it doesn’t matter what “most” believe, only what is *true* (most
    believed the world was flat, for example, but that didn’t make
    it true).
-   Argument from authority — “theologians”. Just because someone has a
    PhD doesn’t make their opinion automatically true.
-   Ad Hominem — “most serious”. In other words, if you don’t believe
    what they say, you’re not “serious”.

All those are designed to change your opinion, *without actually
providing any real evidence*. None of those deal with the issue — is
it true?

The commenter only presents one real argument — the Book of Revelation
was written about events which already occurred. This idea we can
examine as a matter of fact, not opinion — it should be a simple matter
to prove or disprove the only actual argument the commenter provided.

Scholarship: Has Revelation occurred already?
---------------------------------------------

> The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with
> blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees
> was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up. (Revelation 8:7)

Hmmm. A *third* of trees and all the green grass was burned up? Don’t
recall that happening, do you?

> And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had
> life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed
> (Revelation 8:9)

A third of sea-life, and a third of all ships gone? Must have missed the
headlines. And of course, these famous verses:

> And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and
> bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads.
> And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the
> name of the beast, or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him
> that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the
> number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.
> (Revelation 13:16–18)

That hasn’t happened either.

A simple, casual reading of the text proves the error of the “serious
theologians” theory of Revelation as a matter of fact. It’s not an
opinion, it’s obvious these things haven’t occurred in history, so their
bizarre ideas discredit them from any serious contention on the order of
someone saying the sky is orange.

You’re free to accept or reject the Bible as you wish, but a “serious
theologian” expecting you to believe Revelation already happened
deserves as much credibility as a “serious mathematician” wanting you to
believe 2+2=5. Sadly, those who fail to do their homework accept bizarre
ideas like this, social justice, collective and/or universal salvation,
replacement theology, and more heretical, against the Bible ideas.

Next week, we’ll discuss the danger of failing to take the Bible as it
is, as we prove Jesus was a Reagan/Bush Republican, not a liberal
social-justice Democrat — a common sense position *nobody* can
Biblically disprove.
