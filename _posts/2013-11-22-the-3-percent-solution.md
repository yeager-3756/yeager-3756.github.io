Headlines in the last few months reveal an administration failing to
tell the truth, spies on citizens, and believes using drones to kill
American citizens is acceptable. Not to mention quantitative easing,
promoting debauchery,
and more. As our country continues to slouch toward Gomorrah, many
wonder how the ship can be turned around. How can we possibly get enough
people to return to correct values?

It turns out much can be accomplished by a few, if those few have deep
convictions. When the Jews finally were able to return to the land after
captivity, only about 3% accepted the offer. Living in bondage provided
security, while freedom and liberty requires commitment
and—gasp—responsibility.

> If ye love wealth greater than liberty, the tranquility of servitude
> greater than the animating contest for freedom, go home from us in
> peace. We seek not your counsel, nor your arms. Crouch down and lick
> the hand that feeds you; May your chains set lightly upon you, and may
> posterity forget that ye were our countrymen. — Samuel Adams

Of all the Jews, only a small minority preferred liberty and God’s work
over dependence on handouts. Yes, we see a parallel today with too many
looking toward a government to provide all their needs, instead of
obtaining for themselves.

We live in an age of greed and bailouts.

The church has become weak and slack, as heresies like social justice
become popular fads, replacing an individual responsibility with the
government.

Is it possible for the church to throw off heresies like social justice,
common good, and liberal theology,
and actually perform productive and Godly functions? How many would it
take for the church to once again become effective?

Only 3%.

Only 3% of the Jews returned from captivity to restore Jerusalem. Only
3% of the people fought in the American Revolution and founded a country
— one we see slipping slowly away as the church fades into irrelevance.

If 3% would stand up and challenge perverse theology like social
justice, and actually focus on the true Gospel, we stand a chance of
changing course. If not, churches in the United States will become
exactly as those in Europe — wonderful buildings, but spiritually dead
and ineffective.

The stunning amount of Biblical illiteracy in the pews is sickening.
That illiteracy remains the only way so-called pastors can pawn off
poisonous deceptive liberal theology masquerading as Christianity. If
enough people in the pews possessed basic Biblical knowledge, those
heresies would be stopped cold.

If you’re attending a church focused on pot-lucks, heresies like social
justice, and failing to teach line by line through the entire Bible, you
must ask yourself — is that training equipping you to be ready?

What would you do if your pastor and elders were unavailable to you?
Would you have sufficient Bible knowledge to train and equip others?
Or do you hope a super-hero will always be around to
bail you out of tough spots?

It’s up to you, because at 3AM you’ve got what you’ve got.

If you *are* unprepared right now, don’t worry about past mistakes. You
can begin immediately to increase your ability to survive in a spiritual
dark alley at 3AM. No matter what level you’re currently at—master or
beginner—the ability to learn more *always* exists.

How to begin? First, begin with basic bible commentators.
Men like Chuck Smith, Walter Martin, and others provide a firm
foundation for later study.

… because it’s 2:59AM.
