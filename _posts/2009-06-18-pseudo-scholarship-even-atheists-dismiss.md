We’ve mentioned previously a book by a “scholar” utterly lacking basic
logical and Biblical analysis as a warning not to depend on Phd’s and
other accolades to give credibility to some theory. Another book by that
“renowned Bible scholar” has come under fire … by an
[atheist](http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=27) desperately trying to
show no God exists, yet we’ll agree with the atheist the “renowned Bible
scholar” uses bogus “scholarship”, in spite of their title.

The atheist notes this “renowned Bible scholar” uses bogus
“scholarship”, contradicting himself in the process. As we continue to
warn, be *vary* careful with those calling themselves “scholars” or with
PhD’s and other titles behind their names. That means *nothing* save
they’ve received accolades from others who think the same as they do —
do your own homework as many “scholars” turn out to be completely wrong,
and some don’t appear to even read the book they claim to be a
scholar on.

On the reliability of the New Testament, this atheist agrees on the
reliability of the Bible passed to us. For some reason, only “Christian”
scholars doubt the reliability of the New Testament and seek to tear it
apart. Skeptics generally accept the Bible as almost completely pure but
find other faults, as he goes on to state:

> It is more honest (and much easier) to undermine the reliability of
> the New Testament using its own numerous contradictions and inherent
> implausibility. Everyone outright rejects the many other claims of
> god-men who come to earth, perform some magic, die, and rise from the
> dead. Why treat Jesus any different? Because a group of people from a
> superstitious age said so? Seriously?

We’ve looked at many of those “contradictions” before, and will continue
to answer the most popular claims of the atheist. If you’ve got one,
send it using our contact link (please do *not* send massive lists
you’ve cut and pasted from other sources — we’ve seen those before, and
most of them are so absurd they don’t deserve an answer); we’ll answer
the most popular ones.

You must do your own homework, study the Bible for yourself, and reach
your own conclusions — don’t rely on anyone calling themselves a
“renowned Bible scholar” — even if they claim to be “Christian”. After
all, if you called yourself the President that doesn’t make it so, does
it? Do your own homework, and decide who Jesus is for yourself.

After all, eternity depends on it.
