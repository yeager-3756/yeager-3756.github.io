summary: Genetic mutations are almost exclusively bad. Since the vast majority of mutations are bad, for evolution you’ll need vast quantities of sequential *good* mutations for an eye to evolve. Too bad the math doesn't work out.

Let’s jump to the 14th floor. Life has spontaneously arrived, and has
begun to mutate and grow (we’ll skip over the abiogenesis problem in
other words). But genetic mutations are almost exclusively bad. In
computer programs, we’d call those bugs; in life they’re birth defects.
Since the vast majority of mutations are bad, for evolution you’ll need
vast quantities of sequential *good* mutations for an eye to evolve, for
example. That quickly becomes mathematically impossible to occur by
random chance, which is why even Dawkins doesn’t hold that position.

So the evolutionist claims mutations aren’t random, and in the example
of abiogenesis, amino acids combine in chemically consistent patterns.
But that won’t work either. Suppose that’s how it works — would you
get anything?

Let’s go back to the keyboard, and consider computer programs. Random
typing obviously won’t produce a word processor. But suppose the keys
follow certain combinations consistently. “A” follows d, e follows x, d
follows e or z, and so on. What would you get? Just patterns, but no
*information* — no word processor.

Since DNA/RNA boils down to a computer program, how did information
evolve? You’ve got two possibilities:

1.  It’s random. This *will* create a computer code, given sufficient
    time. But in the age of the universe not enough time exists to
    produce anything useful (the monkeys at typewriters problem).
2.  It’s not random, and some external influence caused it (the Dawkins
    idea) — but whoa, we don’t want to call that “god”.

Beyond the problem of information, science can *never* answer what
happened at t=0 in the universe, because it runs into the Planck time
problem; the beginning of life and the universe becomes a philosophical
question, not a scientific one because it’s impossible to perform
experiments recreating those conditions. Where are the experiments for
abiogenesis? The big bang? It’s *assumed* because evolution *requires*
it, not because we have numerous scientific experiments creating life
from non-life.

How did life and the universe begin? How did information arise?
Remember, the scientific method requires repeatable, verifiable
experiments. If you don’t have numerous experiments, you’ve got
philosophy, not science (if you *do* have scientific experimental data
for abiogenesis, leave a comment with the experiment, those involved,
and the date so we can look it up).

You’re free to do as you wish, but you can’t call it science if it
refuses to follow the scientific method with experimental data. No data,
no science, by definition.
