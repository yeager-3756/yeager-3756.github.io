Not much ever changes — human behavior remains basically the same over
thousands of years. Sure we give it different names and labels, but
underlying behavior doesn’t change much. Thus, when Jesus walked the
earth we’d expect to see Him encounter groups similar to groups today.

Three main groups He encountered were Pharisees, Sadducees, and
Herodians, and their basic philosophy still exists today — we simply
call them by different labels. Let’s take a 20,000 foot look at these
groups, and who might represent them today.

Pharisee (Legalists)
--------------------

The Pharisees ideology can be summarized in one sentence “I don’t smoke
and chew, and don’t go with girls who do.”

They represent the idea if I keep a long enough list of rules, I’ll be
in good with God. That’s why they took a simple command like obey the
Sabbath and turned it into hundreds of rules, believing if they kept
their made-up rules, they’d be righteous before God.

Today you’ll find those saying never have a sip of beer or wine, don’t
ever smoke, no dancing or electric guitar music (and drums are from the
devil everyone knows), and so on. They may (but not always) become a
cult with strict rules.

Sure, we still have Pharisees today, a group who fails to understand the
difference between grace and legalism.

Sadducee (Liberals, Progressives)
---------------------------------

These are the spiritual liberals. They denied the resurrection, and much
of the Old Testament (basically accepting only the five books of Moses).
Sadducees generally don’t accept *all* of the Word of God, and what they
*do* accept they’ll modify to suit their liberal beliefs.

This group continues to expand today. They’ll tell you the Gospel doesn’t really mean what Paul said,
they’ll redefine sin and other things, all using tactics of rebellion.

Many post-modern groups fall into this category — progressives,
liberals, emerging-this, post-modern that, social justice, common good,
etc.

It could be popular with people who want to *say* they’re Christian,
without actually *being* Christian. Using post-modern philosophy and
it’s denial of absolute truth, “Christians” can thus live anyway they
like, simply by using liberal theology to deny any or all of the Bible
they don’t like.

Unfortunately, those seeking to deny parts of God’s Word are becoming
more popular.

Herodian (Political Action Group)
---------------------------------

Herodians aligned themselves politically with the government.

Some groups today look to involve government in various ways to
accomplish their goals. From the fad of social justice to those
attempting to set up a theocracy, to those who believe people must set
up a perfect government before Jesus can return, Herodian ideas still
tempt many.

Those trying such ideas miss a simple point: government involves the
affairs of men, not God. Yes, they should use Godly principles to govern
by, but theocracy and other mingling usually won’t end well.

What is Truth?
--------------

Even Pilate wanted to know.

Jesus was a conservative against the hyper-legalism of the Pharisees,
the liberal, progressive Sadducees who “modernized” the Word of God, and
the Herodians seeking to use political power to accomplish their goals.

All those groups were wrong then, and still wrong today.

It’s a shame we can’t simply use the Word of God, but the one thing we
learn from history is man learns nothing from history, as the groups
Jesus squared off against still exist today.
