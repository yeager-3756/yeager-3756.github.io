People wonder why the United States doesn’t play a role in end-times
prophecy. Some believe after the rapture most of the country will be
gone, thus the country essentially ceases to exist. Others have
different theories; in the end they’re all guesses.

Perhaps a quote from the past sheds some light on it.

> America is like a healthy body and its resistance is threefold: its
> patriotism, its morality, and its spiritual life. If we can undermine
> these three areas, America will collapse from within. (Stalin)

Three things the United States has going for it (according to Stalin):

1.  Patriotism
2.  Morality
3.  Spiritual life

Stalin believed corrupting those three would cause the country to
collapse. So how are we doing?

**Patriotism became a four-letter word**. It’s fashionable to believe
the country is inherently bad and evil — or even causes most of the
problems in the world. Two views exist: The first acknowledges the
country makes mistakes, but remains basically good and stands for
liberty, while the other believes it’s mainly bad and evil, and needs to
be “fundamentally transformed” into something else, with more control
over citizens and less liberty (here and abroad) — a new world order.

**Morality sunk to new lows** as value relativism took over. With TV
programming continuing to sink lower and lower, not even the family hour
remains safe from the toxic ooze seeping across the country (oops, they
call that “pop culture” now). As the country abandons God, atheist
theology declares value relativism
and even claims no absolutes exist.
In other words, everyone does what is right in their own eyes, and the
only absolute is the idea **no absolutes exist** (the one thing value
relativists proclaim — absolutely).

**Spiritual life in decay**. As we see bizarre doctrine infecting the
church — in some cases even replacing the Gospel of Jesus,
the average church-goer fails to defend the true gospel against
counterfeits due to both the failure of pastors to teach truth, and
failure of people to “vote with their feet” and leave churches failing
to adequately teach truth.

Will Stalin be proved correct? Could these three ideas cause the
collapse of the country, and perhaps that’s why it’s not in prophecy?

We certainly don’t know the future, or can provide a reason why the
United States doesn’t appear. However, **it’s time for the church to
stand up and get the country to reverse course** back from where it
came, as the road it’s on will not provide a happy ending.

It’s time for an action plan for the future.
Three simple ideas:

1.  Study your Bible. Once or twice a week during church won’t get the
    job done. If you’re intimately familiar with the truth, you’ll
    quickly spot counterfeit gospels.
2.  Study the Armor of God — you must understand and properly use the
    tools God’s given you.
3.  Get involved. Make your opinion known, and support those candidates
    and positions espousing Biblical principles, and shun those failing
    the test.

If the country abandons God, it’s because the people allow it, and if it
be Godly, it’s because the people demand it.
