This week we’re diving into formal fallacies. Of all logic errors, these
appear the most academic and technical. Don’t worry, all you need to
understand comes from the following picture:

A logical statement expresses *if something, then something*, or A ⇒ B
(read *if A, then B*). For some reason, academic texts use *p* and *q*,
so you’ll see things like p ⇒ q. We’ll stick with A and B, however.

Return to the picture and think about *A* and *B*. Clearly, if you are
in *A*, you are in *B*. Thus, A ⇒ B, or A *implies* B, or if *A*, then
*B*. All are equivalent statements, and you’ll see them all used. For
our purposes, let’s stick with *if A, then B* or A ⇒ B.

See, logic isn’t really that hard, is it?

Technical Jargon
----------------

Let’s get some technical jargon out of the way. We can arrange *A* and
*B* in other ways by negating one or the other (written with a tilde,
like *~A*), or switching the order to get:

-   If B, then A (B ⇒ A)
-   If NOT A, then NOT B (~A ⇒ ~B)
-   If NOT B, then NOT A (~B ⇒ ~A)

Those are known as the converse, inverse, and contrapositive of the
original statement. Assuming A ⇒ B is true, are these other statements
equally true?

As it turns out, only *one* of those is true. Which one? Look back at
the picture.

-   If I am in B, then I am in A. Obviously not true. Anywhere in green
    I am in B, but not in A, so the statement is false.
-   If I am NOT in A, then I am NOT in B. Also not true for the same
    reason.
-   If I am NOT in B, then I am NOT in A. TRUE.

I think I can read your mind: you’re thinking “so what”? Let’s apply the
previous and discover the first three logical problems we’ll cover.

Affirming the Consequent
------------------------

A fancy name for using the using the converse of an argument and
claiming it to be true:

1.  If *A*, then *B*
2.  *B*
3.  Therefore *A*

Why is it wrong? Because the statement A ⇒ B does not mean the *only*
way to get to B. What if Z ⇒ B? Then B can be true without A being true,
if Z is true.

The problem becomes much easier to spot with an example:

> If it’s sunny tomorrow, I’m going to play golf (A ⇒ B, A is sunny day, B is golfing)

Affirming the consequent means if I play golf tomorrow, it’s sunny.
That’s not *necessarily* true — it might be or might not be, we can’t
tell from the original statement.

What if it rains, and I decide to play golf anyway?

The mistake of affirming the consequent comes from believing it’s the
*only* way from A to B. And that’s not true.

Here’s another example you might have seen before:

> The theory of evolution predicts fossils of a certain kind. We find
> these in the ground, therefore, evolution is true.

Same mistake. Let’s simplify it a bit: given *Evolution ⇒ Fossils*,
proceeding to claim *Fossils ⇒ Evolution*.

That’s a logical error — it’s not the *only* way to get from A to B.

> In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth (Genesis)

It also appears in global warming proponents and the (in)famous “hockey
stick” graph. Global warming says rising Co2 means higher temperatures,
we’ve seen those, thus the theory is true.

Affirming the consequent is sneaky, is it not?

Denying the Antecedent
----------------------

Another fancy term, this time for claiming the inverse to be true
(without proving it). Specifically: A ⇒ B also means NOT A ⇒ NOT B (or
~A ⇒ ~B) will be true as well.

1.  If *A*, then *B*
2.  Not *A*
3.  Therefore not *B*

Once again, looking at the picture at the beginning of the article shows
this doesn’t work — it’s another error in critical thinking. Another
example:

> If I run a marathon, I will be thirsty. I did not run a marathon,
> therefore I am not thirsty.

That’s not true. I’m eventually going to be thirsty whether I do or do
not run a marathon. I might get thirsty *faster* or need more water from
running, but it’s not the only way to get from *A* to *B*.

It should be noted both the converse and inverse *may* be true. However,
they can’t be *assumed* true from the original statement, they require
proof of their own.

The reason the mistake can be hard to spot is because some of those
arguments *are* true.

1.  Humans can speak (Humans ⇒ speak)
2.  It’s not human
3.  Therefore, it doesn’t speak

Denying the antecedent in this case turns out to be true, *even though
it’s a logical error*. It works because (as far as we know) humans are
the only creatures which speak — it really *is* the only way from *A* to
*B* — *A* is both a necessary (required) and sufficient condition for *B*.

Thus, *A* and *B* are equivalent — either both are true, or both are false.

Law of non-contradiction
------------------------

Non contradiction simply means A can’t be NOT A, or “~A ⇒ A.”

That seems so obvious, surely nobody would claim such a thing? Knock
Knock — go answer your door.

Standing before you appear two nicely dressed gentlemen, telling you
they’re Christians too. Who is Jesus, you ask? Is He God?

Well, no, they reply, we’ve got this additional book telling us Jesus
isn’t actually God.

So you don’t believe the Bible, you ask?

Oh yes, we do, they reply.

Gotcha! They violated the law of non-contradiction.

You see, it’s rather trivial to show Jesus is God from the Bible. See my
article [The Confusion of Religion](/downloads/Confusion.pdf) for exactly
how (I keep several copies by the door to use as a handout when they
come by, and you’re invited to do so as well).

They stand before you claiming the Bible is true, while denying what it
says. In short, “~A ⇒ A.”

As a side note (more in the previously mentioned article), do *not*
engage in arguments about whether Jesus is—or is not—God. You simply
want to point out they believe two things which can’t be true *at the
same time*.

-   The Bible is true and authoritative.
-   Jesus isn’t God.

I *never* state Jesus is (or is not) God, only present the logical
problem they find themselves in. For this purpose, we don’t really care
if Jesus is God or not, only attempting to open their eyes to the
horrible contradiction they’ve spun for themselves.

If I say the sky is orange, and you say it’s purple, *at least one of us
is wrong* (maybe both). But we can’t both be right.

### Non-Contradiction and Liberal/Progressive Theology

Liberal “Christians” fall in the same logical trap promoting the
big-tent view (all world religions are equal) — even a casual reading of
the world’s religions reveals many exclusive statements — *they can’t
all be right*.

Liberal and progressive so-called Christians run into this problem many,
many times. They all say the Bible is inspired by God — right up until
they reject parts they don’t like.

Gotcha! The law of non-contradiction.

> All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for
> doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
> righteousness (2 Timothy 3:16).

All means all, that’s all all means.

If liberal “Christians” believe the Bible, that means *all* of it is
inspired, *including the parts they want to throw out* like the gospel and
sin — errors originating from the cult of liberal theology.

Still not convinced liberals actually argue the absurd idea ~A ⇒ A?
Consider the foundation of liberal and progressive theology —
post-modern philosophy,
from an article from “Christianity Today.”

<blockquote cite="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2007/february/11.35.html?start=3" title="Christianity Today">
<p>The third kind of emerging postmodernity attracts all the attention. Some have chosen to minister as postmoderns. That is, they <b>embrace the idea that we cannot know absolute truth</b>, or, at least, that we cannot know truth absolutely. They speak of the end of metanarratives and the importance of social location in shaping one’s view of&nbsp;truth.</p>
</blockquote>

Minister as post-moderns? *That means denying God’s truth.* At its root,
post-modernism argues absolute truth doesn’t exist, so you have your
truth, and I have mine.

<blockquote cite="http://www.redletterchristians.org/is-postmodern-christianity-dead/" title="Red Letter Christianity">
<p>… a postmodernist is more comfortable with the both/and perspective, allowing multiple truths to exist in tension. It recognizes the significance of subjective reality on our understanding of truth, and as such, challenges more rigid doctrines, dogmas or policies that value uniformity of thought over pluralistic coexistence.</p>
</blockquote>

Buzzword Alert!

-   “subjective reality”
-   “multiple truths”
-   “pluralistic coexistence”

Notice the problem? They state absolute truth doesn’t exist, except for
the one absolute truth is relative.

Gotcha!

They’re arguing absolute truth does — and yet does not — exist, (or ~A
⇒ A) violating the law of non-contradiction.

Liberal theology makes no sense and is unbiblical for many reasons, but
the primary reason not to bother with it is it fails the most basic of
logical tests — the law of non contradiction.

Don’t waste any time with liberal, progressive, post-modern so-called
Christianity. It’s not even worth five seconds of your time. It’s
laughably absurd, denying God but lacking the guts to admit it … but
that potluck sure was good, wasn’t it?

Conclusion
----------

These mistakes occur frequently, and in fact most of us make these
mistakes daily and the world doesn’t end. However, when trying to reason
from one idea to another, it’s *vital* to use correct critical thinking
and logic, or the conclusion fails to be valid.

That’s a long section. Additional articles in the series won’t be so
technical; we’ll focus more on recognizing and correcting common logical
errors.
