A bizarre liberal concept is “Christian Atheism” — the idea Jesus didn’t
really exist (and/or wasn’t God), but we should follow the *teachings*
and morals of Him, even though it’s only a fabrication. It’s
Christianity without God.

I have a college degree, and honestly it’s difficult to read this stuff,
because frankly, most of it makes no sense — the words put together form
sentences grammatically impossible to understand.

I’m reminded of a story Walter Martin told when he was in school
involving his liberal theologian professor. A scholarly article came
out, and Walter *tried* to understand it, but couldn’t as it contained
liberal-speak, so he took it to his old pal the liberal professor.

> Dammed if I know!

Yes, so much mumbo-jumbo exists it’s hard to decipher. Like the
emperor’s new clothes, many times even liberals can’t understand it, but
repeat how wonderful it is just so nobody thinks it’s complete doggy
poo-poo.

Christian atheism? Could two words create a bigger contradiction?

Thomas Altizer wrote a book “The New Gospel of Christian Atheism,” and
I’m sure it’s popular with liberals everywhere. Like Walter, I ask can
anyone explain the mumbo-jumbo?

That reads like someone threw darts at a board filled with big words,
stringing the result together. Classic hand-waving tactics to create
distraction from the total nonsense put forward.

Christian atheism appears to divorce God from Jesus.

Why would anyone want to do this? One possible reason — some people want
to *appear* religious without actually *being* religious. For them,
Christianity without God fills the need.

If Jesus never existed, God can be denied. Better yet, we can construct
our own “god” and do whatever we want. Have a sin you want to continue?
Just claim passages in the Bible no longer apply, or that book
supposedly written by Paul was really a forgery, so we don’t have to
follow it.

What’s left? Potlucks. And an empty shell of a church was has all the
form of Christianity without the pesky problem of actually having God,
leaving the gospel of social justice
and good works, but not sin, redemption, Hell, or Jesus as God.

Such movements Jude warned about.

> For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old
> ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our
> God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord
> Jesus Christ. (Jude 4)

… as well as Peter

> But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there
> shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in
> damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring
> upon themselves swift destruction. And many shall follow their
> pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil
> spoken of. (2 Peter 2:1–2)

Progressive, liberal, progressive, atheist “Christianity” makes God in
man’s image.

Whatever you call it, it has no relation to God, it’s deception, it’s
wrong, and it deceives many people.

Frankly, I have more respect for the actual atheist who shakes his fist
at God and says you don’t exist, than for liberals and progressives who
like the swishing of the robes, but want nothing to do with the God of
the Bible, don’t want to follow His rules, and attempt to hide their
open rebellion and contempt for the creator of the universe.

You can believe the Bible, or the liberals, but not both — they
represent opposites. Liberals want everything from Christianity except God.

My brain hurts from all this nonsense, but I read it so you don’t have to.
