Yes, it does keep thee and thou, and that’s important to distinguish
between singular and plural, as we noted in our 
[Bible Translation]({% post_url 2009-01-01-which-bible-translation-best %}) article,
in the section “Olde English”.

The 1967 Scofield only updated archaic words and words which changed
meaning. It notes the changes with vertical bars, and places the
original word in the side margin.
