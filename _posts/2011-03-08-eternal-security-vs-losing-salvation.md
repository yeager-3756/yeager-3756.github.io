Through the years, one of the most popular articles on this site
involves losing salvation
drawing some rather heated comments. It appears many people struggle
with this issue, especially the Hebrews six passage (read the linked
article for the full analysis). Since this topic causes so much anxiety
and problems, let’s step back and consider it from a different angle.

First, it’s difficult for some people to accept if they did nothing to
earn their salvation, that means they can do nothing to lose it. Most
people accept salvation is by faith alone, not works, but are unable to
arrive at the conclusion that also means **you can do nothing to lose
your salvation either**.

Math contains a concept called indirect proof. You begin with a
statement (assumption), then logically follow where that statement
leads, and if it arrives at an impossibility or absurdity, the original
statement *must* be false. Indirect proof is also called [proof by contradiction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction).

Let’s **apply indirect proof to the possibility of losing salvation**.

First, assume it *is* possible to lose your salvation, where does that
assumption lead you?

1.  You *can* lose your salvation.
2.  Thus, your actions cause either a keeping or losing of salvation.
3.  Thus, salvation is based on your actions.
4.  Thus, salvation is works-based.
5.  Additionally, Jesus’ death on the cross was insufficient for
    salvation, and requires our works to complete the job.

Obviously, numbers four and five are absurd, thus the original statement
(you can lose your salvation), is false.
[QED](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Q.E.D.). In the
end, the possibility of losing salvation requires the following
two ideas:

1.  Salvation is by works, not faith.
2.  Jesus’ sacrifice was insufficient.

Neither of those are good choices, but for those who believe it’s
possible to lose your salvation, those are the logical conclusions
you’ll arrive at. Since they’re both absurd, the original assumption you
can lose your salvation must be false.
