If you’ve been paying attention (and you have), you’ve noticed previous
weapons serve primarily defensive functions. Not so the sword, so it’s
time to get offensive.

> the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God

The common sword contained a long, curved edge, sharpened on one side
and used with a hacking motion; the Romans innovated a short sword (only
18–24 inches) sharpened on both sides. With this revolutionary new
military weapon, they conquered the world.

However, it requires considerable training to master — swinging around
wildly *hoping* you hit something won’t work. Failure to train insures
failure.

Yes, that means slaughtered like a pig. Would you rather be the pig, or
Chuck Norris?

The Roman sword was stunningly successful. However, if I handed you one,
told you it was the most advanced weapon in existence, and told you go
out there and get ’em, would you be successful?

Nope, you’d be the pig.

Fighting and martial arts requires training — and training is tough.
It’s not fun, but when you find yourself in a dark alley (spiritually
speaking) at 3AM, it’s only then you’ll discover if you’re really a
black-belt, or simply a pretender.

The same with the Bible. Too many Christians fail to use the power
they’ve been given because they fail to train — and fail to take their
training *seriously*.

Chuck Norris takes training seriously.

Your sword can be both an offensive and defensive weapon, but more
importantly, it’s the *only* offensive weapon you’ve got. Intellect,
money, power, prestige, are useless to advance on the enemy with.

We’re grabbing for weapons which are proven ineffective, and then wonder
why the church is so anemic.

> Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to
> be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. (2 Timothy 2:15)

If you’re not studying, you’re not training.

It’s time to get serious about your training. Where to begin? Try 5 Bible commentators.
to start. Begin with Chuck Smith — you can obtain his *entire* Bible
study on MP3 for $30 — the cost of a few pizzas.

Which would provide more benefits?
