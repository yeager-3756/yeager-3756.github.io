While reading a social justice website to keep up on the latest news, I
stumbled across a post complaining about one of the social-justice
crowd’s favorite dead horses — healthcare and the cost of prescription
drugs (it’s those eeeeevil drug companies, you know). They complained
about the costs in the United States verses elsewhere (Canada,etc), and
when they did, I almost fell out of the chair laughing.

Why?

The social justice crowd states as the richest nation in the world it’s
up to the United States to “share the wealth” (by confiscation and
redistribution if necessary) with other people and countries.
[Redistribution is the essence of the gospel]({% post_url 2010-08-02-social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel %})
after all (not really, but read the linked article to see how social
justice perverts the Gospel of Jesus).

Of course, they fail to understand that’s *exactly* the situation with
prescription drugs — people in the United States pay higher prices to
subsidize Billions in research and development costs for the rest of the
world as they benefit from artificially low prices. Simply put, the
social justice crowd got *exactly* what they want (redistribution), but
now complain about it. Why complain when getting what they want?

Because it’s *their* money being redistributed this time. Social Justice
demands someone *else* pay for charity (the “rich”, “corporations”, and
so on), instead of themselves. Where did Jesus teach to have the
government confiscate assets for redistribution? Oh, wait, He didn’t.
It’s *your* job to help people, not lobby the government to have it
forcefully taken from others to fulfill *your* responsibility.

Social Justice perverts the Gospel of Jesus Christ into a godless gospel
of government, transferring the responsibility we have to help to
someone else (social justice proponents say to take assets by force
using the power of government if necessary), all so the social justice
crowd can feel good about how much they “helped” — as long as it’s
someone else paying for it.

Why not help others with their resources, instead of confiscating other
people’s assets? Forced charity — an oxymoron (like “social justice
gospel”, but we digress).

Social Justice — “Because it’s easy (and fun) to give away other people’s money”.
