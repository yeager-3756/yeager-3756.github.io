A curious trend among some modern Christian movements (progressive,
liberal, post-this, emerging-that, etc) **you’ll frequently hear liberal
“Christians” claim part of the Bible doesn’t apply today**, or what Paul
meant was really this, or this is an allegory for that — arguing for
anything *but* what the text clearly says. Naturally this causes
problems, as who gets to say what the text says, if it doesn’t say what
it clearly does?

In the end, you’re left with a designer pick-n-choose religion,
not Christianity.

This malady of butchering the text doesn’t occur in normal conversation.
Suppose I texted you to an invite for dinner Friday. Would you argue
about what did I really mean? Was it really an invitation to a hockey
game? Or was it just a cultural idiom?

You’ll laugh at such absurdities, yet that’s exactly what some do to the
Bible. When Paul wrote about xyz, he didn’t really mean xyz, he really
meant abc. Or this isn’t really in the Bible, but you should believe
it anyway.

Bizarre. Tactics of rebellion are these.

Rebellion
---------

**You’re free to accept or reject the Bible** as you wish, but groups
like social justice movements, liberal progressive “Christianity”, and
so on (whatever is the latest buzzword) all do the same thing — deny
what the Bible says (read that: rebel against God) — using two
main tactics:

1.  That was for another time, the Bible needs to fit in with today’s
    society so that part doesn’t apply.
2.  That doesn’t really mean what it says, it’s actually an
    allegory for…

Using their liberal methods proves [Jesus was a Reagan Conservative]({% post_url 2011-04-05-jesus-was-republican-not-democrat %})
who despises Democrats — and it’s *impossible* to prove otherwise. Go
ahead, try — you’ll fail.

Reject the Bible as you Wish - just don’t rewrite it.
-----------------------------------------------------

If you don’t like the Bible, fine. It’s your choice. But you look rather
foolish claiming when Paul said one thing (and it’s abundantly clear),
he really meant something completely different.

Those “Christians” (and we use the term loosely) live in deception.
**Why they choose to call themselves Christian as they reject large
swaths of the Bible** is a question only they can answer. They may like
the name, but they sure don’t like the doctrine.

We’ll note it’s a standard Saul Alinsky method you don’t have to *be*
moral, but you have to cloak yourself in morality for people to buy what
you’re shoveling. In other words, you don’t have to *be* Christian, but
you have to *appear* Christian to trick the church into accepting what
you’re peddling — which many times directly contradicts the Bible.

Saul Alinsky dedicated his book (“Rules for Radicals”) to Satan and
rebellion, so the question becomes — why do people who claim to be
Christian use methods designed to deceive, and dedicated to Satan?

Tactics of rebellion are these.
