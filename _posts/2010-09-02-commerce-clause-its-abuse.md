Perhaps you’ve heard the controversy over Obamacare and its
Constitutionality, specifically regarding the commerce clause, as Pelosi
and company claim the commerce clause gives the Federal government the
authority to force you to purchase a product — you’re a criminal simply
for being born if you don’t take action.

Many (most?) normal people who simply read The Constitution see this as
an absurd abuse of the commerce clause, but remember politicians aren’t
normal people; they seek to increase power any way they can.

We won’t make predictions on whether Obamacare will survive the
challenge, but we can note a previous case using the commerce clause and
you’ll get an idea of how politicians believe they can use the commerce
clause to do whatever they want without restriction, and how courts grab
things out of thin air nobody else would ever consider based on the
plain text.

The 2005 GONZALES v. RAICH SCOTUS case involves a California person
growing marijuana for their own medical use (don’t get hung up on the
“medical marijuana” debate or you’ll miss the point). That’s legal by
California law, but not by Federal law. In the case of conflicting law,
what would the founders proclaim? Should the Federal government have
authority to trample states’ law? That’s the ultimate question before
the court.

The claimed authority comes via the commerce clause — the idea Federal
regulations between states and countries are legitimate use of Federal
authority. But if a person performs an activity which *never* crosses
state lines, how can the Federal government claim authority via the
commerce clause? What interest does the Federal government have in
regulating private state matters in that situation? See what the
court ruled:

> (b) Congress’ power to regulate purely local activities that are part of
> an economic “class of activities” that have a substantial effect on
> interstate commerce is firmly established. See, e.g., Perez v. United
> States, 402 U.S. 146, 151. If Congress decides that the “’total
> incidence’” of a practice poses a threat to a national market, it may
> regulate the entire class. See, e.g., id., at 154—155. Of particular
> relevance here is Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111, 127—128, where, in
> rejecting the appellee farmer’s contention that Congress’ admitted power
> to regulate the production of wheat for commerce did not authorize
> federal regulation of wheat production intended wholly for the
> appellee’s own consumption, **the Court established that Congress can
> regulate purely intrastate activity that is not itself “commercial,”
> i.e., not produced for sale, if it concludes that failure to regulate
> that class of activity would undercut the regulation of the interstate
> market in that commodity**. The similarities between this case and
> Wickard are striking. In both cases, the regulation is **squarely within
> Congress’ commerce power because production of the commodity meant for
> home consumption, be it wheat or marijuana, has a substantial effect on
> supply and demand in the national market for that commodity**.

In other words, because he *wasn’t* buying across state lines (i.e.
interstate commerce), he might affect other areas of the country due to
his *lack* of purchase, and thus, it’s really interstate commerce, and
the Federal government can regulate it.

Yes, the ruling really means **INTRA**state commerce is now
**INTER**state commerce, (the ruling re-defined the English language).
Doublespeak at its best — Orwell would be proud.

Does anyone with even a vague understanding of the founding fathers
believe they intended such conclusions? When activist courts re-define
language to get whatever opinion they want, *any* legal arraignment can
be redefined to whatever the Feds desire — The Constitution may as well
not exist as it means nothing. As Justice Thomas said in his dissent:

> Respondents Diane Monson and Angel Raich use marijuana that has never
> been bought or sold, that has never crossed state lines, and that has
> had no demonstrable effect on the national market for marijuana. If
> Congress can regulate this under the Commerce Clause, then it can
> regulate virtually anything—and the Federal Government is no longer
> one of limited and enumerated powers.

Justice O’Connor also dissented:

> The Court’s definition of economic activity is breathtaking. It
> defines as economic any activity involving the production,
> distribution, and consumption of commodities. And it appears to reason
> that when an interstate market for a commodity exists, regulating the
> intrastate manufacture or possession of that commodity is
> constitutional either because that intrastate activity is itself
> economic, or because regulating it is a rational part of regulating
> its market.

In essence, the verbal twister on defining interstate commerce gives the
government unlimited power to do *anything*, as both Justice Thomas and
Justice O’Connor note.

Expect to see similar lines of argument in support of the newly expanded
Federal power grabbed by the national health care law. Again, don’t
become involved in the issue of national health care, but be *very*
concerned about the staggering increase in Federal power. Ask yourself
one question:

If the act is upheld, do *any* limits on Federal power remain? Does The
Constitution maintain any limits, or continue to protect any rights?
