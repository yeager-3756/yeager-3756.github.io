Let’s consider a front-page problem today — Social Security as part of
the [Federal government deficit]({% post_url 2010-04-19-increasing-federal-deficit %}).
The **discussion illustrates something vital in your spiritual life —
understanding truth-lies** and the methods people use to deceive you
(even in the so-called Christian church).

Deception infects much more than politics as the church falls for the
poison of liberal theology;
understanding truth-lies and logic will become essential to your
well-being. **It’s not only a political issue, but spiritual as well**
as the current discussion over Social Security provides another example
of the importance of logic and critical thinking.

Don’t fall for tricks John Loeffler calls “truth-lies” — something which
might be technically true, but used to deceive or give a false
impression.

You’ve heard politicians boldly proclaim Social Security isn’t part of
the deficit, and shouldn’t be involved in deficit reduction discussions.
Is this true? The CBO says about the Social Security “trust funds”:

> … certain taxes—especially payroll taxes for Social Security and
> Medicare, which are credited to those trust funds—may lead taxpayers
> to believe that they have paid for future benefits. Trust funds can be
> useful mechanisms for monitoring the balance between earmarked
> receipts and a program’s spending, but they are basically an
> accounting device, and **their balances, even if “invested” in
> Treasury securities, provide no resources to the government for
> meeting future funding commitments**. When those payments come due,
> the **government must finance them in the same way that it finances
> other commitments—through taxes or borrowing from the public**. (CBO
> paper "Measures of the US Government's Fiscal Position Under Current
> Law", September 2004, page xi)

It’s like you wrote yourself a check for $1,000,000 and said “look how
rich I am!” Of course, actually *cashing* that check means you have to
get the money from somewhere — borrow it or earn it.

The same with Social Security. The so-called trust fund contains nothing
but IOUs (Treasury Bonds). When Social Security cashes the bonds the
Federal government must borrow or raise taxes to pay for it — exactly as
the government’s own CBO states.

The “surplus” of Social Security has been taken by the government and
spent. **There is no surplus, trust fund, or savings** of any kind, and
when the bill comes due, one or more things *will* happen:

1.  Borrowing to continue massive Federal deficits.
2.  Massive tax increases to pay entitlement benefits.
3.  Huge inflation of the currency (aka Quantitative Easing.
4.  Failure to pay Social Security promises.

That day comes *very* soon — as soon as Social Security taxes fail to
pay for current benefits (negative cash flow, or paying more in benefits
than taken in in taxes). As it descends deeper and deeper into red ink,
those tax increases/benefit cuts/deficits/inflation will become
stunningly large.

There is no free lunch,
contrary to how you’ve been lied to by the Administration and Congress
who believe they can continue to spend your money without limit, and the
bill won’t come due.

Similar to the [myth of the Clinton budget surplus]({% post_url 2010-06-01-truth-lie-myth-surplus %})
(which surplus never existed), or the myth stimulus creates jobs
this myth has a *small* element of truth to it (a trust fund exists),
but it’s only used to deceive people into believing something which
*isn’t* true (Social Security can use that fund to pay benefits without
increasing taxes or borrowing).

It’s a “truth-lie.” Yes, technically it’s true Social Security has a
fund, but it holds government IOUs (Treasury Bonds), which means when
Social Security needs those funds to pay benefits — surprise! — those
funds will come from borrowing, raising taxes, or inflation.

**Anyone believing otherwise hasn’t done their homework**.

*All* wrong. *All* deception. *All* easily cast off by those who study
their Bible seriously.

Beware the truth-lie. Do your homework. Don’t be deceived.
