*“That’s going to leave a mark”*

Not the first time I’ve thought those words. Probably not the last.

The pain wasn’t too bad, my first thought was crap, this will make
Saturday’s Taekwondo tournament a whole lotta fun — I hope it’s not too
stiff by then.

As the swelling increased, so did the language — to other four letter
words which aren’t family-friendly. I soon realized the chances of
competing Saturday decreased rapidly with time.

Down to the ER (our family has the ER club card — after nine visits the
tenth is free), and X-rays revealed a bone (fourth metacarpal) in
multiple pieces.

Crappier.

Normally the family treks to the ER together (Rule 1: the family sticks
together), but I was confident this was a waste of time; I only went to
prove I was fine. Rub some dirt on it, and
keep going.

The doc tossed the picture on the bed as if it was the jack of spades
[trumping](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/trumping) my ace.

I wanted to toss my lunch, cursing myself for violating rule one and now
being alone. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.

The nurse soon arrives, and fashions a temporary brace. I sat waiting
the docs final instructions.

I asked the doc about removing the brace. Sure, he said, just be
careful. A loophole! Careful means spinning the bo staff a bit slower
than normal. I’m in!

Like Abraham haggling with God over Sodom in Genesis 18, I upped the
ante — what if I competed Saturday? I can take the pain…

Negative. He began talking about bones pushing through skin, and after
that I really didn’t hear much.

I lost that round as well.

On the way home I popped in an 8-track of “Allison Long’s Greatest Hits”
and by the time I got home I felt … crappy.

I was devastated. I’m at a loss for words to describe it, so I’ll let
someone else say it.

> Why are you doing this to us? You promised you would never, ever give
> me more than I can handle, yet here I am Lord. I am broken, I am
> depressed, I want to die, God. Why didn’t you just let me die when I
> had the chance? I can’t do this anymore.

I thought of fibbing a bit and saying the doc said I could compete if I
could take the pain — yet another reason not to break rule number one.

Crappiest.

Competing with Junior that day would be one of my all time
life-highlights — and just about the last item on my bucket list.

I let him down, and couldn’t stand it.

Besides that, I didn’t want to go through the hell of a cast, left
handed eating, not tying my own shoes, and more. I’ve been down that
road before, and once frankly was enough.

Double-crap sandwich with a side of self-pity. To say I was crabby would
be an understatement.

As Friday came and went crabby remained, like a black cloud ’o doom
hanging overhead.

Pastor Chuck Smith once said when he’d stand at the back of the church
after service people would tell him his message was just for them. He
would privately think, no, that was for *me*.

I’m no different — we all need reminders of the same things:

-   Stay in the game, but you still don’t get a pony.
-   You may not get a Lexus, an ice cream, or a pony.
-   At 3AM, you’ve got what you’ve got.

When going through tough times, many think they can’t make it, God
abandoned them, and they’re all alone.

It’s not just you, we *all* have those feelings.

<blockquote cite="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0745664/quotes?item=qt0298057">
<p>This guy’s walking down a street when he falls in a hole. The walls are so steep, he can’t get out. A doctor passes by, and the guy shouts up, “Hey you, can you help me out?” The doctor writes a prescription, throws it down in the hole and moves on. Then a priest comes along, and the guy shouts up “Father, I’m down in this hole, can you help me out?” The priest writes out a prayer, throws it down in the hole and moves on.</p>
<p>Then a friend walks by. “Hey Joe, it’s me, can you help me out?” And the friend jumps in the hole. Our guy says, “Are you stupid? Now we’re both down here.” The friend says, “Yeah, but I’ve been down here before, and I know the way out.”</p>
</blockquote>

We need to help each other out of the hole.

I’m just a regular graying-hair old guy. If I can do it, you can too. I
don’t have a cape. I didn’t write the New Testament like Paul. I’m no
superhero.

But I do know one simple truth: never quit, never give in, never
surrender. *Remove those phrases from your vocabulary*.

You don’t drown by falling in water, you drown by not getting up.

Don’t think *I’ll try and see how it goes*. That’s a setup for failure.

Step up to the plate. Get in the game. Get off
the bench. Dare to try great things; fail sometimes you will. Much
hassle, there is. Laughed at, for sure.

Be the man in the arena while others sit it out.

You will have dark times. You will have 3am moments all alone. You will
experience pain.

Maybe nobody is around, and what you’ve got is what you’ve got.

Because it’s 2:59am, and you may not get a Lexus, an ice cream, a pony …

… or a fourth metacarpal in a single piece.
