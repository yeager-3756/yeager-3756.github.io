The First Amendment returns to the spotlight as the prayer issue rears
up again. Is that acceptable expression protected by the First
Amendment? Or prohibited by the same amendment?

> Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
> prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of
> speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to
> assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.

Regarding religion and government, two ideas are clear:

1.  Congress shall make no law establishing religion (i.e. national
    church).
2.  Nor prohibit the free exercise of religion.

Tension exists between those two ideas. Can government both prevent
establishment of national religion while protecting God-given right to
free expression?

In the recent case concerning prayer before meetings in *Town of Greece
v. Galloway*, <abbr title="Supreme Court of the United States">SCOTUS</abbr> wrote:

> Since 1999, the monthly town board meetings in Greece, New York, have

SCOTUS reversed the reversal of the Second Circuit, permitting the
prayers. Naturally, some people are upset; a few lawyers who
participated in the case complained:

<blockquote cite="http://www.religionnews.com/2014/05/06/commentary-town-prayers-what-does-supreme-court-mean-by-coercion/">
<p>The court’s decision, though, invites continued litigation: Nondiscrimination, coercion, and the question of mandatory attendance and penalties will continue to cause disputes …</p>
<p>There were alternatives to this troubling opinion: The court might have taken a strong position and declared that there should be no “official” legislative chaplains and no official governmental prayer</p>
</blockquote>

The first paragraph displays a stunning misunderstanding of SCOTUS
decisions, by complaining the decision leads to further lawsuits. Yes,
it probably will, *but that’s the way SCOTUS decisions usually work*.

-   Did the ruling on abortion eliminate further lawsuits?
-   When SCOTUS held the second amendment clearly states an individual
    right to bear arms, did lawsuits over the issue stop?

No, to both questions.

-   On abortion, what constituents an “undue burden”?
-   On arms, what are permitted? Can government restrict who may carry what?

Obviously SCOTUS didn’t define those issues, and when parties can’t
agree, lawsuits begin.

That’s the way SCOTUS decisions usually work. That may not be a good
thing, but you can’t logically argue against this decision unless you
also argue the court was wrong to permit abortion.

The second complaint—that the court didn’t declare official chaplains
can’t exist—equally exhibits stunning ignorance of history and common
sense. But then, lawyers concern themselves with *law*, not common
sense.

Step back in Mr. Peabody’s wayback machine. Back to the times of the
Founders, Jefferson, and Madison.

Jefferson and Madison attended church services *in the House of
Representatives*; using Capital buildings for church services [continued until after the Civil War](http://www.wallbuilders.com/libissuesarticles.asp?id=90).

Many think Jefferson anti-religious, citing the (in)famous “wall of
separation” phrase. But as the Library of Congress notes, Jefferson
didn’t mean religious displays were impermissible, as his actions
clearly don’t back up what proponents of the wall think it means.

<blockquote cite="http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel06-2.html" title="Library of Congress">
<p>Within a year of his inauguration, Jefferson began attending church services in the House of Representatives. Madison followed Jefferson’s example … Worship services in the House—a practice that continued until after the Civil War—were acceptable to Jefferson …</p>
<p>Jefferson’s actions may seem surprising because his attitude toward the relation between religion and government is usually thought to have been embodied in his recommendation that there exist “a wall of separation between church and state.” In that statement, Jefferson was apparently declaring his opposition, as Madison had done in introducing the Bill of Rights, to a “national” religion. In attending church services on public property, Jefferson and Madison consciously and deliberately were offering symbolic support to religion as a prop for republican government.</p>
</blockquote>

Obviously, neither Madison nor Jefferson had a problem with (gasp!)
using government buildings for religious purposes.

Later, the House itself resolved sessions to be opened with prayer, see
the [Journal: 1st-13th Congress. Repr. 14th Congress, 1st Session - 50th Congress, 2nd
Session](http://books.google.com/books?id=fKkFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA354), page 354

Be honest — after all the anti-religious hysteria involving church and
state, would you believe such a resolution could exist?

The debate over [a Christian nation](/tags.html#/a-christian-nation)
is settled — it’s a matter of record.

People may want to change the future of the country, but the past
remains stubbornly clear.

Militant atheists
attempt to re-write history, but only look foolish in the process.

Lawyers and common sense don’t always go together, but consider the text
of the First amendment and ask yourself if opening a meeting with prayer
*makes a law establishing a national religion*.

It clearly doesn’t, thus is *not* against the First Amendment.

For those arguing otherwise, please cite the bill and law number
supposedly created. If they can’t, it’s not a law, thus acceptable by a
common sense plain reading of the Bill of Rights.

Opening government meetings with prayer has been a foundation of the
United States. People may not like it, but history shows it, and the
Founders by their actions clearly agreed.

SCOTUS only upheld what has occurred in this country since its founding,
agreeing with the Founders actions.

To do otherwise would be judicial activism.
