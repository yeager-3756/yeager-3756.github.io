Homeschooling can be a touchy subject — both in the church and out.
[NBC](http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/39342787/ns/today-parenting/) ran a
series of articles on homeschooling and reading the discussion you’ll
find it’s a topic with virtually no agreement, heated discussions, and
(in some cases) a complete lack of evidence supporting opinions. You’ll
hear the following arguments:

-   If a Christian doesn’t homeschool their kids, it’s a sin.
-   Homeschooled kids are socially inept, and unprepared for the future.
-   Parents are unqualified to teach their children.
-   Students must be taught by “certified” and “credentialed” teachers.

If you’re a Christian we’ve heard it said if you *don’t* homeschool
you’re sinning against God, while others claim parents don’t possess the
qualifications to teach their own children (and making the attempt
borders on child abuse). As usual, those extremes are wrong. Do your own
homework; don’t settle for cliche thinking.

Whether to homeschool or not remains an individual choice of families.
However, if you *don’t* at least consider it, you’re doing a disservice
to your child (and avoiding the Biblical command to be a good steward).
To begin, consider what a classical education involves, and how it
differs from what the public education system provides. To begin the
comparison read [The Core: Teaching Your Child the Foundations of Classical
Education](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Core/Leigh-A-Bortins/e/9780230100350/).
It’s worth $10 to introduce the topic.

As you begin to investigate, you’ll quickly notice many people make wild
statements without any evidence to back it up (our favorite: only 10% of
parents are qualified to teach their children. Of course, it’s a fact
78.387% of statistics are made up).

Most people agree the public school system fails miserably, and grows
worse each year. The disagreement comes upon asking how to fix it, and
if parents should homeschool or send their children to private/charter
schools instead of waiting for a solution for the public system which
may never arrive.

What is the purpose of education? That should be an obvious question,
but it may surprise you education isn’t always the focus of public
schools. Thus, we must agree on *what* education should encompass.

<blockquote cite="http://market-ticker.org/akcs-www?singlepost=2143215">
<ul>
<li>The purpose of a K-12 education is to impart the basic knowledge necessary to succeed in society.  We will define this as “Reading, Writing, Mathematics, History and Hard&nbsp;Sciences.”</li>
<li>K-12 education is not “socialization”, it is not “religious studies”, it is not “babysitting” and it is not “surrogate child-rearing.”  Parents perform those functions, for better or worse — it is both their responsibility and the proper exercise of their&nbsp;authority.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s further agree that the best educational outcomes consistent with reasonable amounts of money spent are the goal. That is, School is not a “social experiment”, a means by which we perform what amount to scientific experiments on children — a barbaric practice that, were it to be put this way and understood, virtually everyone would recoil from in&nbsp;horror.</p>
</blockquote>

The elephant-in-the room question: are parents qualified to provide
that education?

<blockquote cite="http://today.newsvine.com/_news/2010/09/27/5190398-as-home-schooling-moves-to-mainstream-stigma-fades?commentId=17925504#c17925504">
<p>America needs to send its children to school and provide them a rigorous education by qualified educators — not isolate them in the home away from their peers. Common culture and sense of heritage are built on common experiences. Development of social skills depends on interaction with groups of peers (i.e., groups of other&nbsp;children).</p>

Get all the kids thinking the same — group-think at it’s best (or
worst). Follow the herd! Moooooo!

Two different methods of logic exist: [didactic and dialectic]({% post_url 2009-06-06-didactic-dialectic-thought %}).
If you’re older than 40 or so, you likely have been trained didactically
(facts, reason, and logic), while if you’re under 35, most likely you
only know dialectic (group consensus). Dialectic uses group-think to
arrive at a consensus — which obviously may or may not be correct.
Worse, people trained in dialectic process have difficult times
examining a set of facts to arrive at a conclusion.

Public schools the way we know them are a *recent* invention. The
Department of Education didn’t exist until 1980. 1980! How could Lincoln
communicate so effectively without a Department of Education? How did
the founders ever write the Declaration without “qualified educators” in
public schools? How did Patrick Henry declare “Give me liberty or give
me death!” without the assistance of certified teachers? How did
Einstein develop the theory of Relativity without the
education bureaucracy?

Case closed on “qualified educators” — it’s obviously incorrect as most
of our history did *not* involve public education, producing some of the
greatest minds ever. *Since* the advent of public eduction (and the
Department of Education), has the involvement and money
improved education?

<p>While some parents are arguably better qualified to teach their children at home than their teachers at school, the solution is not to take scarce resources away from the school. If these parents are so good, and have enough time to home-school their children, perhaps they could be useful as professional&nbsp;teachers.</p>

Wait a minute, instead of saving our kids, we should chain them to the
deck of the Titanic so they’ll go down with the public education ship?
What parent would do that? Why allow your child to be experimented on
when other proven methods exist? *My child is not a social experiment.*

If a parent can wonderfully instruct their child, does that mean they
should become a teacher? Perhaps not. You see, the parent can choose the
methods and tools to best instruct their child, while in the public
school system those choices are removed from local control and placed
with either the state or the federal government. Thus it’s possible to
take a wonderful parent who teaches effectively and turn them into just
another cog in the system — by forcing the rigid ideology of the public
school system.

Also notice the we-need-more-money argument rears it’s ugly head. Of
course, the more money poured into schools and unions, the worse results
have become. What did Einstein say? Insanity is “doing the same thing
over and over again and expecting different results”. We’ve dumped
truckload after truckload of money, and failed. Will the 41st truckload
suddenly create fantastic results? Doubtful.

Does any sane person claim public schools have been anything but a
staggering failure? The reasons and solutions may be (hotly) debated,
but it’s virtually unarguable the current situation remains a stunning
failure — even more so *after* the founding of the Department
of Education.

The skills required are *how* to think for yourself, using research and
logic to arrive at conclusions, by yourself. Unfortunately, schools may
not teach logic and deductive reasoning, instead relying on group-think
and consensus to arrive at a conclusion. Of course, if the group thinks
2+2=5, it really doesn’t matter what the group thinks, does it? It’s
still wrong (but at least they feel good about being wrong). The absurd
idea if you answer 2+2=5 you’re okay if you feel good about it is
laughable — and tragic. Do you want your doctor to think that way? Even
fake TV characters understand right and wrong do exist.

That’s quite a shock if you’ve been educated in a group-think
environment where the facts didn’t matter much and value relativism
reigns, along with self-esteem (“Johnny feels good about 2+2=5, let’s
not hurt his self-esteem by telling him he’s wrong”).

Should you homeschool? That’s a decision made by each individual family.
For some, it fits, others not. Before you make a decision, one book you
should read is “The Core”, by Leigh A. Bortins. For those thinking the
public education system is the best education, consider how it’s changed
in the last years.

If you’re interested in your child’s future, you *must* investigate
public school alternatives. You may or may not choose to use the
alternatives, but at least make an informed decision on the issue.
Investigate the public school curriculum and see what they’re teaching.
Do they teach logic and reason, or group-think? Do they teach the basic
knowledge or include other social issues which don’t belong in basic
education? Examine for yourself, and come to your own conclusion.

Stewardship demands it, and common sense requires it.

As educrats continue to scream “more money” while results worsen, why do
educators continue to use what has been proven *not* to work? Do they
care about the kids, or just beefing up their status by using the latest
cool buzzword acronyms? Think that’s a bit harsh? Consider the 
[longest running study of educational styles](http://pages.uoregon.edu/adiep/ft/watkins.htm) from 1965 until
1998; it proved a single method (called “direct instruction” or “nuns in
the classroom”) worked best.

The question remains — as results continue to tumble, why won’t public
schools teach using the method that works? Are they executing the
[Cloward-Piven strategy]({% post_url 2010-07-03-cloward-piven-strategy %})
applied to education?

Public education moves from one jumbled acronym to another — this year
it’s “outcome (performance) based education” next it’s “Reform
mathematics”, next it’s “Project-based learning”, mixed in with
self-esteem, and so on.

We *know* what works best (direct instruction and the three R’s).
Schools need to return to *proven* methods, instead of trying to win a
contest of buzzword bingo. If your school refuses to use proven
effective methods, homeschool allows you to avoid the disaster, at least
until the system decides to correct itself. Study the issue for
yourself, and come to your own solution.

Why won’t public schools use what works? After all, it’s for the kids.

Until they do, do you want your child chained to the deck of the Titanic
as it sinks?

*My child is not a social experiment.*
