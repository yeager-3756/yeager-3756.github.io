As the administration’s comments and speeches are vetted and approved in advance (and usually read from a prompter), it’s not simply a slip of the tongue but an intended policy change.

Recently a storm erupted regarding the change in phrasing from “freedom
of religion”, to “freedom to worship”. As the administration’s comments
and speeches are vetted and approved in advance (and usually read from a
prompter), it’s not simply a slip of the tongue but an intended policy
change; it’s a conscious change in language, and since the phrase has
been used by the President himself, it’s reasonable to conclude he is
not only aware of the shift, but approves of it.

But is it a big deal?

Yes, it is. Freedom of worship implies you’re protected to enter your
synagogue/church/mosque/temple and have whatever service is appropriate
to your faith. But that’s all. Keep it off to the side, and most
importantly, don’t allow it outside the building — that’s not protected.

Freedom of religion involves much more than worship services in a
building — it involves your entire life and the manner in which you
conduct it.

Some might argue it’s not a big issue, as the Constitution protects
religion. So to review, here’s part of the First Amendment:

> Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
> prohibiting the free exercise thereof…

When courts rule a high school valedictorian can’t mention God in their
speech due to the first amendment, ask yourself how “Congress” morphed
into “private citizen”, and “law” morphed into “any public expression”;
as courts make such an obviously incorrect atheistic view of the first amendment
it highlights the importance of keeping the proper rights enshrined in
the Constitution in proper focus.

So yes, it’s a significant policy shift. It’s a subtle change, but like
many along the slippery slope, it’s one step down the path to
eliminating God from public life.
