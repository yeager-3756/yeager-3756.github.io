Don’t we all want to have a spirit filled life? Then we must be able to
resist attacks of the enemy. Satan uses lies and deception to keep us
wandering in the wilderness, unfocused and powerless to engage the
enemy; **the idea a Christian can lose their salvation causes much
anxiety**.

First, we’ll examine two passages commonly taught as “proving” a
Christian can lose their salvation, and second, discover some absurd
ideas losing your salvation would imply (if it were possible).


## Troubling Verses

### Hebrews 6:4–6

> For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have
> tasted the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy
> Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age
> to come, if they fall away, to renew them again to repentance, since
> they crucify again for themselves the Son of God, and put Him to an
> open shame. (Hebrews 6:4–6 NKJV)

Yikes! **Does this mean a Christian can lose their salvation**? But what
can they not be renewed to, salvation? NO! The word used here is
*repentance*. We equate repentance with salvation, but that’s not
necessarily so. To fully understand this, we look to another passage in
Hebrews and a few other of Paul’s writings.

> Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of
> witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily
> ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before
> us, (Hebrews 12:1 NKJV)

Paul was always concerned with his running a race. **Paul did not fear
losing his salvation, but being unfruitful**. He exhorts us to lay aside
any weight hindering us, and run with endurance the race before us, as
Paul brings out similar ideas in his other writings.

> For no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is laid, which
> is Jesus Christ. Now if anyone builds on this foundation with gold,
> silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each one’s work will become
> clear; for the Day will declare it, because it will be revealed by
> fire; and the fire will test each one’s work, of what sort it is. If
> anyone’s work which he has built on it endures, he will receive a
> reward. If anyone’s work is burned, he will suffer loss; but he
> himself will be saved, yet so as through fire. (1 Corinthians 3:11–15 NKJV)

**It’s clear Paul talks of rewards, not salvation**. Even if a person
loses all their rewards by living a carnal and unfruitful life, they are
still saved. Paul echoes this race theme in his writings.

> Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives
> the prize? Run in such a way that you may obtain it. (1 Corinthians 9:24 NKJV)

Paul’s first focus was always heavenly, not earthly. **The issue is the
jeopardy of heavenly rewards, not salvation**. Paul makes the
distinction between the two clear, and the conclusion about the passage
in Hebrews is the following:

> The primary reference of this passage is to Jewish believers in the
> sense of them being called out of Judaism. Thus, this is NOT a
> Salvation passage. It is talking of the fruits, the making of our
> lives into useful ministries. … Those who have lost their first love
> (Revelation 2). As we emphasize the idea that Jesus did the whole
> deal, we run the risk of sitting back on our security and not
> recognizing that we are in a race. Paul was preoccupied with this idea
> of being in a race. Only Christians are in this race, Paul was not
> running a race with sinners. Paul’s fear was not that he would lose
> his salvation, but that he would have an unproductive life and have
> his witness curtailed.(Chuck Missler “Hebrews” page 73)

### 2 Peter 2:20–21

> For if, after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through
> the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again
> entangled in them and overcome, the latter end is worse for them than
> the beginning. For it would have been better for them not to have
> known the way of righteousness, than having known it, to turn from the
> holy commandment delivered to them. (2 Peter 2:20–21 NKJV)

Taking only these verses is a critical mistake. Chapter two starts out
with a warning about false teachers, with the thought continuing
throughout the chapter. They are “wells without water” (17) “for whom is
reserved the blackness of darkness forever” (17). And when we arrive at
verse 20, the subject remains false prophets. **It is not *about*
Christians, it is a warning *for* Christians**.

Notice the wording of Peter, he uses the phrase “knowledge of the Lord
and Savior Jesus Christ”. Does this imply they were saved? Hardly. James
provides a commentary on what knowledge is good for in terms
of salvation.

> You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons
> believe; and tremble! (James 2:19 NKJV)

Are demons saved by their knowledge? I don’t think so, as **knowledge
does not imply salvation**. The passage in Peter talks about false
prophets who were never saved in the first place; it does not, can not,
apply to Christians.


## Eternal Security

Now that we have dealt with two troublesome passages, finding out what
they don’t mean, you may ask is there any evidence we can’t lose our
salvation? Certainly.

> “My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me. “And I
> give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; neither shall
> anyone snatch them out of My hand. “My Father, who has given them to
> Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of My
> Father’s hand. (John 10:27–29 NKJV)

Notice the explicit phrase here, “they shall never perish”. **If you
could lose your salvation, you would perish, and Jesus would be a
liar**, thus it must not be possible. But also notice two hands here,
the Father and the Son. The picture of one hand over the other — a
complete enclosure — so that “no one is able to snatch them out”. That’s
comforting, because I’m a man, and if no one can snatch them out, I
can’t snatch myself out.

Later Jesus, just before his betrayal, had this to say in his prayer to
the Father.

> “While I was with them in the world, I kept them in Your name. Those
> whom You gave Me I have kept; and none of them is lost except the son
> of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled. (John 17:12 NKJV)

**It’s not up to us to maintain our salvation**. Jesus does all the
work. Whose job is it to keep the sheep? Certainly not the sheep, they
are too stupid. It’s the shepherd’s job to keep the sheep. And one of
Jesus’ seven “I AM” statements in John is “I AM the good shepherd” (John
10:11). If Jesus is the shepherd, he isn’t going to lose any sheep.

### You Did Nothing to Earn Salvation, Right?

Ephesians 2:8–9 says we are saved by faith, not by works. In fact, even
the faith to believe is a gift from God! Logically, **if I didn’t do
anything to obtain salvation, can I do anything to lose it**? I don’t
think so. If God chose us before the foundation of the world (Ephesians
1:4), will he unchoose us later? That would imply he can change, and God
does not change.

Paul has another issue in Ephesians. In chapter 1 verses 13–14, he
speaks of being “sealed” with the Holy Spirit of promise. **If God seals
something, I don’t see how it could be unsealed**. Paul continues to
speak of the Holy Spirit as “the guarantee of our inheritance”. A
guarantee of being sealed isn’t worth much if it’s possible to lose your
salvation and become unsealed.

The real problem is *not* can you lose your salvation (you can’t), the
real problem is, were you ever saved in the first place? This is perhaps
a more disturbing question than losing your salvation. We are not
speaking of sincere doubts, we all at some point have those (remember
Satan and his deception campaign). Have you made a sincere prayer of
commitment to Christ? If so, you don’t have a problem. If not, do
it now.

Unfortunately, we frequently rely on feelings and experiences, which not
only are unreliable, but can easily be used by the enemy to deceive us.
Satan himself can transform into an angel of light (2 Corinthians
11:13–14). We must anchor ourselves firmly to the rock of the Word
of God.

**Remember this simple truth** — if you did nothing to earn your
salvation, you can do nothing to lose it. If someone claims you can lose
your salvation it logically means they also believe the following:

* Salvation comes by works.
* Jesus’ death on the cross was *insufficient* for salvation.

Those aren’t good ideas, thus **the idea you can lose your salvation
*must* be false**.
