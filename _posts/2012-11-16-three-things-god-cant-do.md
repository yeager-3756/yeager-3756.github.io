Wait a minute, God is all-powerful and all-knowing, so he can do
anything, right? It turns out that’s not true — some things God *can’t*
do. The problem comes from thinking all-power means the ability to do
anything. To use the philosophical argument: Can God create a rock so
big he can’t move it?

Obviously not. For if God creates it, that means by definition He can
control it. So God **can not** create a rock so big He can’t control it.
But that’s not the only thing God can’t do.

## 1. God Can’t Learn


If you already know everything, it’s impossible for you to learn.

That’s good, because it means when I make a mistake tomorrow, it doesn’t
catch God by surprise. Way back in the garden of Eden, Adam’s blowing it
didn’t catch God by surprise, because God can’t learn.

> I am the LORD, and I do not change. (Malachi 3:6 NLT)

## 2. God Can’t Lie


As part of His nature, God can’t lie. Many people talk about the God of
the Old Testament versus the God of the New Testament, but they’re the
same God, as God cannot lie or change.

> So God has given both his promise and his oath. These two things are
> unchangeable because it is impossible for God to lie. (Hebrews 6:18
> NLT)

## 3. God Can’t Make You Love Him


Love implies a voluntary choice, thus it’s not possible to force someone
to love you. In spite of possessing all power and knowledge, in the end
God doesn’t get what He wants — all people to accept Him.

All Power Does Not Mean the Ability to do Anything
--------------------------------------------------

The mistaken idea God can do anything comes up in the [problem of evil]({% post_url 2012-11-14-problem-of-evil %}) as some
say if God is good, and all-powerful, the fact evil exists means He’s
either not all-powerful, or not good.

The problem comes from those believing possessing all-power provides
that entity the ability to do anything, and when looked at logically,
you’ll discover that turns out to be false.
