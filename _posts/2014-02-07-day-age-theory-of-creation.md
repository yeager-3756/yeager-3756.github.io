It’s popular to combine the theory of evolution with Genesis. One method
used to accomplish that claims each “day” in Genesis could be billions
of years, as the Hebrew word *yom* can mean age or other period of time.

Before we solve the problem, *why* do people desire to do this? What
reason exists to reconcile evolution with creation?

Failure to make a choice.

Nobody argued for the day-age theory until recently, *after* Darwin
proposed his theory. The only reason is failure to understand the
absurdities of evolution and
believe it actually contains science.

It does not.

Science uses the scientific method, simply meaning make a guess, devise
experiments to support or disprove your guess, then modify your idea in
response to experimental results.

Lather, rinse, repeat.

Evolution, however, does *not* use that method. Ask where the published,
peer-reviewed, repeatable, experimental data exists for the following
basic concepts of evolution:

1.  Matter comes from nothing.
2.  Non-life suddenly becomes alive.
3.  Explosions produce order.

Without experimental evidence for those, you don’t have science, only
wishful thinking. In other words, you take evolution on *faith*, not
science.

It turns out a smidgeon of truth exists in the day-age idea, as the
Hebrew in Genesis can imply other periods of time, such as age.

The day-age theory doesn’t meet its death in Genesis, but Exodus.

> But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God; in it thou
> shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy
> manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that
> is within thy gates; For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth,
> the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day;
> wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. (Exodus 20:10–11)

In Exodus Moses writes about the Sabbath, where no work could be done on
the seventh day of the week. Moses compares it to creation, connecting
the two. What logical reason could exist for Exodus stating 7 24-hour
days meaning one week for the Sabbath, but billions of years in the
creation comparison?

None.

The context in Exodus makes clear — creation in Genesis was six 24-hour
days or a week the way we normally think of it.

Not billions of years.

You’re free to believe evolution or not, but please, don’t try and
reconcile it with the Bible, because the current theory simply doesn’t
fit.

Next week, we’ll cover another (in)famous idea trying to cram evolution
into Genesis — the gap theory.
