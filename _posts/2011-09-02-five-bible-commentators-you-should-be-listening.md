With so many resources, how do you quickly gain an *overall*
understanding of the Bible, current events, cults, science, logic, and
application? We give you our five choices to begin your study.

## 1. Chuck Smith


Chuck Smith provides an incredible foundation for future study. He’s not
the most technical, the most specialized, or the most involved with
current events, but if you want a framework for future Bible study
Chuck’s the guy to provide it. Best of all, you can get his [*entire* Bible commentary for less than 30 dollars](http://store.calvarychapel.com/cccm_store_/catalog/display.php?psku=828147605076)
on MP3, and his radio program “The Word for Today” runs on radio
stations everywhere.

I can’t imagine any other investment of $30 paying a higher dividend.

## 2. Jon Courson


Jon possesses the unique ability to tell you a 15 minute story from his
life, and just about the time you’re wondering *why* he’s wasting so
much time on it he’ll give you one Bible verse, and make a one-sentence
comment, and you’ll be left thinking *now* I understand that verse.

If you like a laid-back, conversational style with lots of personal
stories and application, you’ll love Jon Courson. His [entire Bible commentary is available](http://www.joncourson.com/store/mp3s/mp3s.asp)
for about a hundred bucks on MP3, and Jon’s radio program “Searchlight” frequently
airs on many radio stations.

## 3. Walter Martin


[Walter Martin](http://waltermartin.com/realaudio.html) is *the* expert
on [cults](http://waltermartin.com/cults.html). If you don’t have his
book [The Kingdom of the Cults](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/kingdom-of-the-cults-walter-ralston-martin/1102560756)
get a copy — it is *the* definitive study on the issue.

Walter’s book is so far above anything else you’ll ever hear or read,
it’s like the Space Shuttle compared to a Yugo.

Walter is also famous for his question and answer radio call-in program,
and compilations of his encounters run on radio stations as
“Essential Christianity”.

## 4. Chuck Missler


If science is your bag, Chuck Missler has it covered. For a general
introduction on relativity, quantum mechanics, probability, and more,
see the [Beyond Collection](http://resources.khouse.org/products/dvd86/), as Chuck
frequently talks about science and how it relates to the Bible.

His main site is [KHouse](http://khouse.org) and his radio program
[66/40](http://www.khouse.org/6640_cat/) is available as a podcast.

## 5. John Loeffler


John Loeffler isn’t so much a Bible commentator, but if you want to
understand current events and how they relate Biblically, John’s *the*
guy to listen to. He frequently covers political, educational, and
logical issues with the overall theme of *what is true*, not what
is popular.

As John says, the herd almost always runs in the wrong direction, and
your failure to be informed doesn’t make me a wacko.

Catch John at [Steel on Steel](http://www.steelonsteel.com/).

Conclusion
----------

Those five resources provide a well-rounded beginning to Bible study. If
you listen to them, you’ll gain a basic understanding of the Bible, how
science agrees with the Bible, understand cults, relate current events
to the Bible, recognize those who fail to use critical thinking and
logic, and much much more.
