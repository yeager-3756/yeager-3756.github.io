The words heretic and apostate get tossed around a bit. Since we
discuss various heresies it’s
important to know what the words *mean*, as well as what they *don’t*.
Christians tend to use them as an insult — when someone gets mad and
they want to say something nasty, they throw out the h-word.

What is heresy, and its similar cousin, apostasy?

Heresy
------

Heresy involves what a person believes (knowledge), and how or what they
promote.

<blockquote cite="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/heresy">
<p>Opinion or doctrine at variance with the orthodox or accepted doctrine, especially of a church or religious system.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote cite="http://machaut.uchicago.edu/?resource=Webster%27s&amp;word=heresy&amp;use1913=off&amp;use1828=on" title="Websters Dictionary 1828">
<p>A fundamental error in religion, or an error of opinion respecting some fundamental doctrine of religion.</p>
</blockquote>

Heresy simply means ideas conflicting with accepted foundational
doctrine. In the case of Christianity, that means the Bible. It says
*nothing* about the character or morality of a person. They could be
Sister Teresa or Satan himself.

Let’s consider an example. Perhaps you’ve heard about “social justice,”
and some say it’s the essence of the Gospel. Is that true? In this case,
it’s not a matter of opinion, it’s a matter of *fact*, because Paul
defined the Gospel for us.

> Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached
> unto you … For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also
> received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the
> scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third
> day according to the scriptures. (1 Corinthians 15)

That’s the Gospel, *according to the Bible*. If someone claims social
justice or other idea is the essence of the Gospel, they’ve made a
fundamental error, an error of opinion regarding foundational doctrine,
and promoted a doctrine at variance with accepted ideas.

A heresy — those supporting such ideas are *heretics*.

The heretic, therefore, is nothing more than someone who accepts or
promotes heresy. It’s not an insult or derogatory, it describes their
beliefs as at odds with orthodox doctrine (i.e. the Bible).

It doesn’t mean they’re bad people, it doesn’t mean they’re evil. They
may be the nicest people who you’d want to live next door. They’re
simply wildly wrong, and in the case of social justice, *as a matter of
fact*, not opinion.

Apostasy
--------

Similar to heretic, many sling this around as an insult. While the
heretic could be corrected by instruction and education, the apostate
generally involves more of a willful abandonment.

<blockquote cite="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/apostasy">
<p>A total desertion of or departure from one’s religion, principles, party, cause, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote cite="http://machaut.uchicago.edu/?resource=Webster%27s&amp;word=apostasy&amp;use1913=off&amp;use1828=on" title="Websters Dictionary 1828">
<p> An abandonment of what one has professed; a total desertion, or departure from one’s faith or religion.</p>
</blockquote>

That desertion could be willful, or due to the improper teaching. An
apostate, therefore, is one who forsakes his religion. For example,
someone who now claims to be an atheist.

Heretics proclaim their religion, while promoting factually false
doctrine; the apostate usually walks completely away from it.

Again, it doesn’t mean they’re bad people, only they’ve decided to
abandon their religion for some reason. Freedom and liberty (which God
gave) means you’re free to believe or not believe anything you want.

That doesn’t make it true, of course, as John Loeffler says “your
failure to be informed does not make me a wacko.”

Words Are Important
-------------------

Communication can only be possible if everyone uses words the same. If I
say put the book on the table, you understand what I mean because we all
use *book* and *table* to mean the same thing.

Problems arise when people fail to use words correctly. The church has
this problem as liberal theology
proponents redefine words.

How does this happen? Something called post-modern philosophy,
sometimes referred to as value relativism, or you have your truth and I
have mine.

When we use terms like Gospel, Jesus, salvation, judgment, and so on,
those words have specific meanings, but if someone twists those meanings
from what everyone else uses, they can sound thoroughly orthodox while
speaking from the pit of hell.

When someone calls a person reading from the NIV a heretic, that’s
simply not possible, as the Bible says nothing about it. The NIV
certainly isn’t the best translation, but using it doesn’t make you a
heretic.

If you really want to insult someone (not a good idea, civil discourse
is always the goal), these words won’t get the job done; they say little
about a person’s character, only their beliefs.

Calling someone a heretic isn’t an insult, used properly, it describes
their beliefs as contradictory with traditional doctrine.

Whether you choose to believe heresy, is of course, up to you.
