Frequently in the church it’s difficult to get anyone to staff volunteer
positions. If you’ve ever been involved in staffing, you’re familiar
with all the usual reasons — young children at home, new job, school,
and more. Getting out of service for God isn’t a new idea, rather it
began way back in the Bible. How far back?

Exodus 3. Yep, Moses.

He first made the infamous “I’m-not-qualified” schtick, but the Lord
wasn’t buying it. Next he tried the, “yeah, but whom shall I say sent
me?” routine, but that didn’t make it far either.

One by one, Moses’ excuses were shot down in flames. You see, the only
question is: are you *willing* to serve God? The Lord doesn’t ask are
you *able*, since He can equip you for whatever duty awaits.

Sometimes people know the right thing to do, but need a little prodding
(see Jonah).

Other times it’s a genuine fear.

Other times it’s simply stalling — Lord, I’m busy right now, but after I
get my Lexus, it’s you and me God. As usual, stalling isn’t a new
problem unique to the modern church. Recall Haggai:

> “Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, saying: ’This people says, “The time
> has not come, the time that the LORD’s house should be built.” Then
> the word of the LORD came by Haggai the prophet, saying, “Is it time
> for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses, and this temple to
> lie in ruins?” (Haggai 1:2–4 NKJV)

During the ministry of Haggai and Zechariah, the people’s basic problem
was getting in the game, and they
actually turned away from building the Lord’s temple to work on their
own houses.

It’s not convenient right now, they said. Once we graduate from school,
start a family, get a good job, finish our house … *then* it’s you and
me Lord.

But that wasn’t the question.

Man since Moses (and likely before) continues to duck service for the
Lord. As Chuck Missler says, never underestimate a human’s ability to
rationalize — sure, *other* people need to stop slacking off, but me,
I’ve got a real excuse.

No, you really don’t.

You don’t *have* to do the Lord’s work — He won’t force you — but don’t
be fooled into thinking lounging on the couch in place of service is
acceptable.

Paul reminded Timothy “Preach the word! Be ready in season and out of
season. Convince, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching”
(2 Timothy 4:2 NKJV), and Walter Martin reminds us the Greek actually
means whether it’s convenient or inconvenient.

Ouch.

Moses finally got in the game. As did Jonah. And Jeremiah. What’s
holding you back right now? After all, it’s 2:59 AM.
