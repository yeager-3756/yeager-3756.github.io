How many will watch the political National Conventions this week and
next? Blah, blah, blah — elect me and the rise of the oceans will slow
and the planet will begin to heal, elect the other guy and baby kittens
will die. After all, we’re the one we’ve been waiting for.

Political conventions — enough manure to fertilize all of Iowa’s corn
fields. How many “promises” from the last campaign were dropped or
ignored *after* the election? Answer: almost *all* of them — it appears
most people understand politicians say anything to get elected, then
ignore their word.

Simply put, a lack of integrity.

It’s what HL Richardson calls “peer-group shift.” Before election, a
politician’s peers are the citizens he hopes will vote for him. After
being elected, his peers become the re-election campaign, PAC’s, special
interests, unions, and anyone waving $$$ around. The citizen? Doesn’t
even make the list.

Most people call that a lack of integrity. It’s no surprise elected
politicians fail the integrity test, as once elected they only care
about reelection and maintaining (or increasing) their power any way
they can.

Integrity is what you do when you can get away with anything (either
because nobody is looking, or you have the power to ignore complaints).

Of course, it’s easy to talk the talk, what about living the talk?
Integrity isn’t something to complain Washington and the Administration
lack, it’s for *everyone*.

A few weeks ago we were in a home improvement store to buy some wood for
a Taekwondo board-breaking competition. We generally break 1-inch think
pine boards, about 6x12 inches. The store only caries 12" wide by
various lengths, usually 6, 8, or 10 feet, so the boards must be cut.

We were in a hurry, so instead of cutting them myself, we let the store
do it. After buying the wood, walking outside into the lumber yard a
store employee cuts however you require. I’ve done this before, and
thought nothing of doing it again, until we spotted the sign:

First 4 cuts free, then $.50 each. Oops. Our board required *many* more
cuts than that.

One more piece of information — the store employees *never* check for a
receipt, you hand them the wood and they cut it. And you’re already
outside the store, so it’s a quick walk back to the car.

Here’s where rationalizing begins.

$.50 a cut? That’s *way* too much. After all, once the saw is set up,
it takes about 5 seconds per cut. Hmmm. The guy didn’t ask for a
receipt, and we’re already outside, nobody will know if we paid the
additional fee.

Rationalizing the dark side leads to, yes — it would be *easy* to avoid
paying, but it wouldn’t be right. *Integrity is what you do when you can
get away with anything.*

We had to lug all the boards back into the store, stand in line, and pay
the additional $4 or so, even when it would have been easier to walk
away.

Why can’t politicians do the right thing? I don’t know, I just know they
don’t, so don’t wait for it. You, of course, as master of your domain,
*do* control whether you act with integrity or not.

Integrity — doing the right thing when you can get away with doing the
wrong thing. It’s not always easy or fun, but it’s the right thing to
do.
