The Helmet protected the head from cavalry attacks, as riders on
horseback used a wide, blunt sword to split skulls of those walking
beneath them. Obviously, if you take such a blow to the head you’re in
big trouble, so how is the condition of your helmet?

This helmet is commonly thought of as being saved, but Paul talks to
Christians — so he can’t be talking about salvation — since he also
assumes you might not have this piece yet.

Rather, he talks of the assurance of salvation — confidence no matter
what happens, the ultimate victory remains assured. Hebrews says without
faith it’s impossible to please God, so part of the helmet involves
having confidence in God’s Word, and thus by extension, salvation.

The Cult of liberal theology
drops passages they don’t like, or claim those were only cultural and no
longer apply today. How dangerous is liberal theology? One tactic
atheists use involves liberal theology
to turn people aside from the truth.

It occurs slowly, drifting away,
First, with foundational ideas like the inerrancy of the Bible. Once
inerrancy is thrown out, liberals attack other doctrines, until nothing
remains save church pot-lucks.

Yes, liberal theology is that dangerous. It’s certainly popular today,
but truth can’t be found by popular opinion.

That’s one deadly danger your helmet protects you from. I’ve spent over
a decade wading through the filth of heresy and liberalism, and can
state without hesitation most of it doesn’t even make sense, let alone
have truth to it.

Remember, mix 1% poison with 99% truth … and you’re still dead.

Never forgot to wear your helmet, much danger there is.

Once you’re immune to liberal heresy, a second danger lurks, waiting to
ensnare you, and that’s wondering if you’re really saved. Christians can
waste considerable time on this, so much that they’re taken out of the
game.

First off, remember works don’t (and can’t) save. Anyone expressing such
a Jesus+ view of salvation is incorrect. Yes, that includes the
incorrect idea baptism is required
for salvation.

That’s step one in obtaining assurance of salvation.

Second, consider Jesus’ own words regarding salvation (after all, He
ought to know).

> And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish,
> neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. (John 10:28)

What does *eternal* mean? Never ending. Always will be. *Shall never
perish*. If you have eternal life, is it possible to lose it? Of course
not.

That means if you’ve given your life to Christ, it’s a done deal.
Assured. For ever.

One more idea. Jesus said no man can pluck them out of my hand. That’s
quite comforting, as I’m a man, which means I can’t pluck *myself* out
of His hand.

> Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or
> distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
> (Romans 8:35)

Protect yourself from the heresy of liberal theology, and obtain
assurance of salvation. Two uses for your helmet, and you’d better be
skilled in both.

… unless you like to be a casualty.
