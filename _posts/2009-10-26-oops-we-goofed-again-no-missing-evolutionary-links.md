The search for the evolutionary missing link continues. It’s funny how
those “missing link” proclamations receive big attention, but what
happens they’re found out to be false? Have you heard *archaeopteryx*
and *Ida* aren’t what they were originally claimed to be? Probably not.

<p>The feathered creature called archaeopteryx, easily the world’s most famous fossil remains, had been considered the first bird since Charles Darwin’s day. When researchers put its celebrity bones under the microscope recently, though, they discovered that this icon of evolution might not have been a bird at&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>An examination of its bone cells revealed for the first time that the 150-million-year-old creature had the slow growth rate of a dinosaur, not a bird, an international research team reported this month. Comparing it with other early fossils, the researchers concluded that the telltale physiology of modern birds likely didn’t emerge until 20 million years or so after archaeopteryx flapped its broad wings across primordial&nbsp;lagoons.</p>
<p>“They didn’t grow like a modern bird,” says Mark Norell at the American Museum of Natural History in New York and a senior author of the research paper published in the online journal PLoS One. “They grew like typical nonavian dinosaurs. Archaeopteryx was not so special. There were lots of animals just like&nbsp;it.”</p>

Archaeopteryx frequently comes up as proof of transitional forms and so
on. But now they discover it’s nothing like what they originally
claimed. Oops. And what about Ida? It’s not as bad as the disaster of
[piltdown man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piltdown_Man), but it turns
out in the quest to accept *any* evidence these two are not what they
hoped for — the holy grail of evolution, the missing link
between species.

<p>Controversial German specimen is related to lemurs, not humans, analysis of an Egyptian find&nbsp;suggests</p>
<p>A 37-million-year-old fossil primate from Egypt, described today in Nature, moves a controversial German fossil known as Ida out of the human&nbsp;lineage.</p>
<p>Teeth and ankle bones of the new Egyptian specimen show that the 47-million-year-old Ida, formally called Darwinius masillae, is not in the lineage of early apes and monkeys (haplorhines), but instead belongs to ancestors (adapiforms) of today’s lemurs and&nbsp;lorises.</p>
</blockquote>

Whenever new “evidence” appears heralding the dawn of final proof of
evolution — no, this time we really mean it — give the new discoveries a
few decades, as these two pieces of history don’t really conform to what
they were proclaimed to be after discovery. And of course, evolution
remains susceptible to the piltdown man hoax, where “scientists” lose
their objectivity and desperately cling to *anything* which “proves”
what they hope for — classic cases of [confirmation bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias).

Once again, the hopes and prayers of evolutionists are dashed against
the cold hard rocks of reality. Keep digging guys. The truth is out
there. Honest.
