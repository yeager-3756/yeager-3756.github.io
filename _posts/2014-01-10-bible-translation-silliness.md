I read many articles on Bible translation, and am amazed at some of the
strange reasons people use to promote their version. While the KJV
remains the undisputed superior Bible text in English, it’s not
infallible, and some reasons its supporters use are … well … just silly.

Saviour vs Savior
-----------------

Someone said the KJV can’t have simple spelling changes like British to
English because changing Saviour to Savior results in a word with 6
letters, which is … well … bad (think Satanic).

Along the lines of playing around with various names to obtain 666 (even
Barney the purple dinosaur), it misses a simple yet critical point.

Greek has well-defined numerical values; English does not.

It’s rather silly to play with number systems and “prove” Bill Gates is
the anti-Christ (though I’d say Windows is a diabolical and evil system
spawned by the devil), because English has no set definition for how
letters should be assigned numerical values.

Someone may prefer British spellings over American, but counting the
letters isn’t a valid reason to accept or reject a translation, and it
certainly doesn’t prove one is evil.

Prevent vs Precede
------------------

Another common reason stating a translation is wrong as they compare
their “correct” translation (whatever that is), and declare whatever
fails to match their preference must be wrong.

For example, using prevent verses precede. People claiming this
so-called error haven’t done their Greek homework. Precede *is* the
correct translation — prevent is Olde English.

Prevent in Olde times *meant* precede (think pre-event), which is why in
1611 it was translated that way. Today we use precede.

Both translations are correct for the time period they were translated
in.

King James Remains the Best
---------------------------

The King James remains (and likely will never be surpassed) the best Bible translation in English.

Just be sure to understand *why* it is.
