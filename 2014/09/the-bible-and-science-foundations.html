<p>The Bible and science. Many say they’re opposites. Yet that’s not true.
An ordered, logical being created an ordered logical universe. In fact,
the only reason science <em>does</em> work is God maintains order. Every time
you drop a rock, it falls — God created gravity such that it <em>always</em>
works, the same way.</p>
<h2>What is Science?</h2>
<p>A big misunderstanding comes from failing to define what science is.
Science looks not for <em>truth</em>, but <em>facts</em>. If debates on truth are your
thing, you’re more interested in philosophy than science.</p>
<p>Science may tell us your bloody fingerprint is on the knife (fact).
However, it’s <em>opinion</em> it means you committed murder.</p>
<p>Science helps with the first, not so much with the second.</p>
<p>It’s why courtroom dueling experts appear. They may agree on <em>facts</em>,
but their conclusions differ.</p>
<p>Many definitions of science exist, but let’s use the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Science gains knowledge through experimental data and deductive logic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No statement for or against God exists — science should be agnostic.
Read that carefully, it does not mean to act as if God doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>Sadly, today science has been compromised and only looks for non-Godly
explanations. It’s atheistic, and that yields incorrect conclusions.</p>
<p>Some things are simply <em>unknowable</em> — we simply can’t discover what
happened at <code>t=0</code> in the universe, because we run into the Planck time
problem (don’t worry, we’ll cover that in a future article when we
answer the question “how fast is the rapture?”).</p>
<h2>Logic</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/series/logic-101.html">Logic</a> is a set of rules
and methods which, when used properly, yields a valid conclusion. It
means if “A” is true, and using valid deductive logic arrives at “B,”
you know “B” is also true.</p>
<p>Sometimes, arriving at “B” — even though we <em>know</em> it’s true — yields a
shocking and unaccepted result. For example, in the early 1900s Quantum
Physics was just beginning. The results were so shocking, decades passed
before acceptance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is often stated that of all the theories proposed in this century,
the silliest is quantum theory. In fact, some say that the only thing
that quantum theory has going for it is that it is unquestionably
correct. Michio Kaku, in Hyperspace (1995) p. 263
<code>http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It matters not what you <em>think</em> about Quantum Physics (and many of its
results are rather bizarre, see Schrödinger’s Cat), only it continues to
agree with experimental data.</p>
<p>However, we <em>must</em> return to methods. Trust them. When used correctly,
they yield correct conclusions.</p>
<p>Sadly, many people (even Phds) make <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2008/04/probability-evolution.html">basic mistakes in math, science and logic</a>.
Why? Because they so desperately want to prove whatever their pet idea
is, they fail to follow sound deductive principles.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most common are <em>argument from authority</em> and <em>argument from
majority</em> — usually pitched as “most of (authority group doctors, etc)
believe”; in advertising it’s “4 out of 5 doctors…”.</p>
<p>Of course, even blindly following a genius like Feynman can cause
problems, as he himself admits, as he speaks about his famous <a href="http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_90.html">Feynman Lectures on Physics</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is remarkable that among the 1165 errata corrected under my
auspices, only several do I regard as true errors in physics. An
example is Volume II, page 5-9, which now says “…no static
distribution of charges inside a closed grounded conductor can produce
any electric fields outside” (the word grounded was omitted in
previous editions).</p>
<p>This error was pointed out to Feynman by a number of readers,
including Beulah Elizabeth Cox, a student at The College of William
and Mary, who had relied on Feynman’s erroneous passage in an exam. To
Ms. Cox, Feynman wrote in 1975,  “Your instructor was right not to
give you any points, for your answer was wrong, as he demonstrated
using Gauss’s law. <strong>You should, in science, believe logic and
arguments, carefully drawn, and not authorities</strong>.”</p>
<p>“You also read the book correctly and understood it. I made a mistake,
so the book is wrong. I probably was thinking of a grounded conducting
sphere, or else of the fact that moving the charges around in
different places inside does not affect things on the outside. I am
not sure how I did it, but I goofed. And you goofed, too, for
believing me.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know many people view the study of logic a boring, dry affair. Yet it
remains critical if we are to come to correct conclusions.</p>
<p>What method shall we use to avoid errors? Glad you asked.</p>
<h2>The Scientific Method</h2>
<p>The scientific method provides the path from not knowing facts to
understanding how the cosmos works.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a guess</li>
<li>Perform experiments to either agree or disagree with the guess</li>
<li>Modify the guess based on experimental results</li>
<li>Lather, rinse, repeat</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s that simple, and yet littered with mines waiting to destroy those
failing to remain diligent. The problem arises when scientists either
fail to use the process, or become victims of <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/03/avoiding-logical-error-science-confirmation-bias.html">confirmation bias</a>
(confirmation bias means seeing any data as proof of your theory).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It doesn’t matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn’t matter how
smart you are. If it doesn’t agree with experiment, it’s wrong.
(Richard Feynman)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Feynman would appear on anyones best scientist list — Nobel prize
winner, Manhattan project, Challenger disaster commission, and author of
the famous “Feynman lectures on Physics.”</p>
<p>In those books and elsewhere, he illustrates proper use of the
scientific method, and how it can be misused to yield incorrect
conclusions.</p>
<p>Used properly, the scientific method forms the basis for science, and
it’s not too strong to say it’s the <em>definition</em> of science.</p>
<p>No experimental data, no science.</p>
<h3>Case Study: Evolution and Scientific Methods</h3>
<p>Many years ago (back when I used to read the morning paper), someone
wrote in with the oft-repeated claim evolution has “overwhelming
evidence.” Being the good skeptic and scientist I am, <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/06/evolutionary-data.html">I wrote a letter to the
editor</a> to
actually <em>see</em> that proof.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John Donovan’s June 2 letter, “Evolution isn’t a philosophy,”
illustrates a common and often repeated error. He states evolution’s
“validity depends solely on evidence … overwhelming support.” But is
it scientific?</p>
<p>The scientific method depends on repeatable, verifiable experiments.
So I’ll wait for the overwhelming number (hundreds) of experiments
showing a few scientific foundations of evolution. First, matter can
come from nothing. Second, non-living material can become alive.
Third, species can change. Fourth, explosions produce order. And for
bonus credit, name 50 transitional forms.</p>
<p>But please pardon me if I don’t hold my breath waiting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Take a few minutes to read the responses. They’re quite funny, and
produced all sorts of nonsense — everything <em>but</em> science.</p>
<p>Most attacked me personally with variations of either I’m stupid (sorry,
college degree), or it’s against my religion (I didn’t mention my
religion, and in any case why bring that into science?).</p>
<p>So for claims of “overwhelming evidence,” <em>nobody</em> could provide it. In
fairness, the average writer to the newspaper isn’t Einstein, and likely
can only barf back what they’ve heard.</p>
<p>One responder even repeated the “overwhelming evidence” claim — without
backing it up with <em>anything</em>.</p>
<p>Sorry folks, around here we use <em>science</em>, not personal attacks and
claims without experimental support.</p>
<p>I’ve asked evolutionists for <em>years</em> to provide valid, peer-reviewed,
published experimental data for the following basic ideas required for
evolution.</p>
<ul>
<li>Matter can come from nothing.</li>
<li>Non-living material can become alive.</li>
<li>Explosions produce order.</li>
<li>Species can change into another.</li>
</ul>
<p>All <em>must</em> be true, or evolution fails. Where is the experimental data?</p>
<p>I’ve given up, and it’s why I don’t write on evolution anymore. Until
they actually provide some science to be discussed, it’s simply
vaporware.</p>
<p>Around here, we use science, so there’s not much to discuss about
evolution. It’s philosophy.</p>
<p>I like philosophy, but it’s not science.</p>
<p>For those who haven’t dug into the absurdity of evolution, use the links
on the right sidebar or search this site and you’ll discover many
articles.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2008/04/probability-evolution.html">The Probability of Evolution</a>
— the famous “deck of cards”</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/06/changing-theory-evolution-or-oops-we-goofed-again.html">Evolution — oops we goofed</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/10/oops-we-goofed-again-no-missing-evolutionary-links.html">Oops, we goofed again</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note:</em> For those whose dogma includes evolution and are incensed I
might question their sacred philosophy by tugging on their security
blanket, all I’m asking for is science — provide a list of peer-reviewed
articles, their dates and publication information, the subject of the
experiment, and the people involved. Internet links and data is all you
have to provide, then we can discuss it.</p>
<p>After all, if “overwhelming evidence” exists, it should be trivial to
produce.</p>
<h3>Darwin Wasn’t Satan</h3>
<p>He proposed a valid theory — one which has <em>not</em> been supported by
experiment as we’ve seen.</p>
<p>However, he’s not the great Satan many Christians make him out to be.</p>
<p>He saw something he didn’t understand, made a guess, and then expected
later data to prove his guess. That is <em>exactly</em> the way science should
work.</p>
<p>He even noted a few objections to his theory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To suppose that the eye, with all its inimitable contrivances for
adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different
amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic
aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I
freely confess, absurd to the highest degree. (Charles Darwin “The
Origin of Species” Bantam Books June 1999, page 155)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem with the eye illustrates fundamental issues with natural
selection. Partially formed eyes don’t contribute anything, so would be
selected out.</p>
<p>And yes, I’ve heard the explanations of how the eye evolved, but I don’t
really want you to spew your coffee on your keyboard, so I’ll refrain —
leave the comedy for Saturday’s stand-up act. We’re about science here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… the number of intermediate varieties, which have formerly existed
must truly be enormous. Why then is not every geological formation and
every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly does
not reveal any such finely-graduated organic chain; and this, perhaps,
is the most obvious objection which can be urged against my theory.
(Charles Darwin “The Origin of Species” Bantam Books June 1999,
page 230)</p>
<p>But, as by this theory innumerable transitional forms must have
existed, why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the
crust of the earth? (ibid, page 144)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2008/03/darwin-evolution.html">Darwin</a>
made a guess, then expected later experimental data to prove his guess.
As already noted, don’t ask to see that data, because it doesn’t exist —
evolution adherents <em>assume</em> it to be true <em>a priori</em> without scientific
experimental data.</p>
<p>No data, no science.</p>
<p>Darwin properly used the beginning stages of the scientific method.
Sadly, later so-called scientists fail to use the most basic principles
of science in their mad and wild support of illogical and unscientific
dogma.</p>
<p>That explains why they fall for hoaxes like Piltown man. They so
desperately desire to cling to their dogma they’ll accept anything which
might support it — even an obvious hoax.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Many people have asked me to write about the Bible and science, which
I’ll be doing a bit more of.</p>
<p>Notice, however, that you can’t simply study science and the Bible,
you’ll also need logic, mathematics, and a desire to throw off old ideas
and embrace wherever the experimental data leads.</p>
<p>Science has failed to do that on multiple occasions, and each time
they’ve hindered real progress by decades or more.</p>
<p>Paul warned you to <em>prove</em> all things.</p>
<p>Good advice from a man who would know.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
