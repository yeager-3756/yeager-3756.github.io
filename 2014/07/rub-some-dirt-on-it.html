<blockquote>
<p>I’m getting hungry, I thought.</p>
<p>Nope, that’s not it. Maybe indigestion. I think I’ll go lay down.</p>
<p>Nope, that’s not it.</p>
<p>Laying on side, back, stomach — nothing mattered. The pain increased.</p>
<p>Wife walks in. Are you okay?</p>
<p>Yeah, but I think I might get a couple aspirin.</p>
<p>You’re kinda pale.</p>
<p>No, I’m fine. Just need an aspirin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>45 minutes later, I was at the ER, going to the front of the triage line.</p>
<p>For the shocker of the week, guys aren’t too smart when it comes to
pain. <strong>Rub some dirt on it isn’t just a slogan, it’s a way of life</strong>,
or as my friend says, “those are just recommendations.”</p>
<p>Both times I’ve broken bones, I didn’t really think they were broken.
Just give me a couple aspirin. I’ll be fine. The last time I didn’t even
need aspirin, just ice it a bit so I can be ready for the Taekwondo
tournament in two days.</p>
<p>Seriously. That’s what I thought, even after seeing the x-ray.</p>
<p>I’m no doctor to be sure, so don’t take anything I say as medical
advice. You’ll live longer.</p>
<p>In fact, the only reason I went <em>to</em> the doctor was to prove I was fine.
Yeah, right. 8 weeks later and I’m back typing again (on the bright
side, I’ve learned to write left-handed, and can tie my shoes again).</p>
<p>Peggy and I are blessed in we can make one phone call, and within
minutes we’d have more people at our house than we could count.</p>
<p>Sadly, I don’t always make that phone call. Stubborn I am, yessss.
Handle it I can, I think.</p>
<h2>Your Assignment, If You Choose to Accept It (and you should)</h2>
<p>You’re in one of two situations right now:</p>
<ol>
<li>You’re in a trial.</li>
<li>You’re not in a trial.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re in group #2, prepare to be in group #1, because it’s going
to happen.</p>
<h3>Group #1 — You’re in the Fire</h3>
<p>If you’re in a trial now, learn from Nehemiah as the Jews rebuilt the
wall of Jerusalem. Not surprisingly, they encountered opposition.</p>
<p>Did they quit? Give in? Yield? I’m sure they <em>wanted</em> to, but Nehemiah
had a better idea.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All the builders had a sword belted to their side. The trumpeter
stayed with me to sound the alarm. Then I explained to the nobles and
officials and all the people, “The work is very spread out, and we are
widely separated from each other along the wall. When you hear the
blast of the trumpet, rush to wherever it is sounding. Then our God
will fight for us!” (Nehemiah 4:18–20 NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep, the church can be spread out, so <strong>blow the stinking trumpet and
allow others to rally around</strong>.</p>
<p>Don’t go solo. Divide and conquer will always be a productive military
strategy. The spiritual arena differs not.</p>
<p>I heard a friend say recently they thought of calling, but didn’t. That
must not be. If you have <em>real</em> friends, they don’t mind being called at
3AM. Really.</p>
<p>Naturally, I don’t recommend it unless it’s really important, but <strong>when
the manure smacks the rotating air mover, it ain’t no time for
timidity.</strong></p>
<p>Group #1 people have a simple task — <em>blow the stinking trumpet</em>.
That’s it.</p>
<p>Yet that may be the hardest thing you’ve ever done. Humans are naturally
averse to asking for help.</p>
<p>Just do it.</p>
<h3>Group #2 — Life is Good</h3>
<p>Your mission is simple — find someone in group #1, and provide
assistance. They may (or may not) blow the trumpet.</p>
<p>Christians fondly say, “Gee, life is bad, well, we’ll pray for you”.
Prayer is good for sure, but sometimes more is required. Don’t be a
slacker.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose you see a brother or sister who has no food or clothing, and
you say, “Good-bye and have a good day; stay warm and eat well” — but
then you don’t give that person any food or clothing. What good does
that do? So you see, faith by itself isn’t enough. Unless it produces
good deeds, it is dead and useless. (James 2 NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To paraphrase James: <strong>Get thee off thy gluteus maximus (butt) and get
in the game.</strong></p>
<p>Pay it forward; sooner or later you’ll be in group #1.</p>
<p>Christianity remains a full-contact activity, and it’s time to get in
the game. You’re never too old, too young, too thin, too fat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you keep quiet at a time like this, deliverance and relief for the
Jews will arise from some other place, but you and your relatives will
die. Who knows if perhaps you were made queen for just such a time as
this?” (Esther 4 NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The huge tragedy? Throughout history, people fail to engage, either from
laziness, or (gasp!) because it takes effort.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So I sought for a man among them who would make a wall, and stand in
the gap before Me on behalf of the land, that I should not destroy it;
but I found no one. (Ezekiel 22:30 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Get in the game.</p>
<p>That’s it for this week. Your assignment over the next 7 days is to
perform whichever task is appropriate for whatever group you currently
find yourself in.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
