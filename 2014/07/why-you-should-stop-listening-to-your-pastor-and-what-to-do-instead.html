<p>The average pew-warmer in church is un-trained, un-prepared, and unable
to perform their combat role, providing little more usefulness than

<p>The reason remains simple: they listen to their pastor too much.</p>
<p>I don’t mean you should stop attending church or heckle your pastor
during the message (I certainly don’t want either when I speak), but you
should (must?) <strong>stop relying on your pastor as your primary source of
knowledge</strong>.</p>
<p>When faced with a herd of zombies, survivors have training for the
zombie apocalypse. The unprepared and those who panic are zombie food.</p>
<p>Too many Christians sit around waiting for Sunday’s spoon-feeding, so
when crisis arises at 3AM they discover they’re woefully unprepared, and
their only recourse is to phone for a lifeline.</p>
<p>Zombies don’t wait to see if your friend answers the phone — you’re food
for zombies if you can’t defend yourself. Period.</p>
<p>And it’s ugly. As in slaughtered like a pig ugly. Because at 3AM you’ve
got what you’ve got, whether you’re facing zombies or your largest
spiritual attack. No difference exists.</p>
<h2>Who Wants to Fight Like Chuck Norris?</h2>
<p>Do you want to be the pig or Chuck Norris kicking some zombie butt? It’s
your choice.</p>
<p>Becoming a black-belt like Chuck Norris takes hard work, dedication, and
a commitment to never give up. After all, zombies may be slow, but
they’re persistent.</p>
<p>You’ll have to work, sweat, and study. It’s not for the faint of heart.
It’s not for couch potatoes. But you’re not in that group, are you?</p>
<p>While zombies might be fictional, certainly other things that go bump in
the night exist. Sadly, too many Christians place those things in the
same fictional category as zombies.</p>
<p>I assure you they’re not.</p>
<p>Whether you believe such things exist or not fails to change the reality
of their existence. The difference between sticking your fingers in your
ears saying “la-la-la, I can’t see you” and being Chuck Norris is one
tends to survive.</p>
<p>Because <strong>you <em>will</em> have those 3AM moments, and you’ve got what you’ve
got</strong>.</p>
<p>Are you ready to engage? Christianity is a full-contact activity. If
you’re not ready, if you deny such things exist, if you don’t want to
engage and rescue others, save yourself some time and don’t bother
reading further.</p>
<p>Go back to the couch, grab the remote, and <em>hope</em> Chuck Norris and
friends will be around when you need them.</p>
<h2>Be a 3-Percenter</h2>
<p>When the Jews returned to Jerusalem under Zechariah and Nehemiah, only a
small number of people returned. About 3%. What can 3% do?</p>
<ul>
<li>Rebuild the wall … and the city</li>
<li>Return to God’s law</li>
<li>Set the tone for the country</li>
</ul>
<p>Only 3% a problem? Hardly … if they’re the <em>right</em> 3%. No
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/09/matrix-guide-christianity.html">pew-warmers</a>
allowed.</p>
<p>In the American Revolution, only about 3% actually engaged in the
battle. In some conflicts, people divide into three groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> are on your side</li>
<li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> are against you</li>
<li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> don’t care</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember the Jews after leaving Egypt? Oh, you brought us out here to
die! Oh, that we were back in Egypt with the leeks and onions! Moses,
what are you doing to us?</p>
<p>A sizable group wanted to return to the bondage and slavery they escaped
from — definitely in the zombie-food category.</p>
<p>The 3-percenters saved them from that fate — the zombie fighters.</p>
<p>Remember, you don’t need a large group to change the course of a nation.
Only 3%. The people and entities aligned against you know that as well,
and be assured they’re plotting with their own 3%.</p>
<h2>What If The Door Slams Shut?</h2>
<p>You should not stop attending church, nor should you ignore your pastor
or other teachers. However, you should attain a combat-level of
spiritual fitness, which <em>never</em> comes from spoon-feeding.</p>
<p>You must work out. Hard.</p>
<p>Real life doesn’t exist the way TV preachers talk — come to Jeeeeeesus
and life will be rosy. Life is hard, and <strong>the truth is you may not get
a Lexus, an ice cream, <a href="https://framesofreferencellc.com/catalog/9780983111740/">or a pony</a>.</strong></p>
<p>To survive you must flip your primary and secondary sources. Your own
study and preparedness becomes primary, while your pastor becomes one of
your resources to learn from.</p>
<p>But the goal is always to be combat-fit on your own. At 3AM when crisis
comes (and it will), you might not be able to reach someone to bail you
out — yes, that means you’re zombie-food again.</p>
<p>All over the world Christians are persecuted for their faith. If you’re
tossed in jail, would your knowledge and skills cause you to die,
survive, or thrive? Could you lead others as Paul did in prison?</p>
<p>If not, you’re not combat-ready, you’re the pig waiting for the
slaughter (or zombie-food, take your choice — either way it ain’t
pretty).</p>
<p>Fortunately, time still remains for training, at least in the USA. For
the most part, we’re free to openly worship and assemble as Christians.
We must use the time remaining to ensure each and every Christian
possesses the ability to function on their own.</p>
<p>Sadly, <strong>the church fails its primary mission</strong>: preparing the saints
for battle.</p>
<p>As the rest of the world shows, it’s only a matter of time before the
ability to meet on Sunday (and what can be said) will be restricted. It
happens elsewhere, why would you think it can’t happen here?</p>
<p>Once that happens, your combat status will be decided — you’ll have what
you have.</p>
<p>The Christian life is not a love-fest with everyone sitting around
singing Kum-by-Ya and eating s’mores. It’s not creating heaven on earth.
Far from it.</p>
<p>It’s a battle. And hard. If it was easy, would not our churches overflow
every Sunday?</p>
<p>They’re not.</p>
<h2>5 Steps From Zombie Food to Zombie Slayer</h2>
<p>If you’re untrained right now, panic thou not. Time still exists to make
the journey from white-belt to black-belt zombie slayer, but you must
begin now.</p>
<p>Where to begin? Start with these five steps.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/series/logic-101.html">Understand logic</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/01/3-steps-choosing-bible-translation.html">Get a good Bible</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/11/post-modern-philosophy-church.html">Learn post-modernism’s poison</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/02/basic-bible-study-library.html">Build a good library</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/09/5-bible-commentators-you-should-be-listening.html">Listen to good Bible commentators</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Get through those, and you’ve already passed beyond white-belt. Good
job!</p>
<p>Need any help? Let us know, <strong>that’s why we’re here — to get you to a
combat-ready</strong> black-belt. We all <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2014/01/having-a-bad-day.html">have bad days</a>. You
can be ready for them … or not.</p>
<p>You should not <em>stop</em> listening to your pastor, but you <em>should</em> study
for yourself. Your pastor is simply another resource you can (and
should) use, but he’s not your personal body-guard.</p>
<p>Because <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/09/matrix-guide-christianity.html">3AM is coming</a>,
and you’re either going to fight like Chuck Norris or be slaughtered for
zombie-food.</p>
<p>You have no other options to choose from.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
