  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Politically correct types might want to avoid this post — those always
complaining about “isms” should cease reading now.</p>
<p>In modern PC thought, I’ve given you a “trigger warning” — proceed at
risk of learning truth.</p>
<p>Okay, the easily offended people who don’t like truth have moved on, we
can continue.</p>
<p>Who today holds a biblical worldview? A study by Barna answered that
question. First, we must consider how the study defined biblical
worldview.</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.barna.org/barna-update/21-transformation/252-barna-survey-examines-changes-in-worldview-among-christians-over-the-past-13-years">
<p> … a “biblical worldview” was defined as believing that <b>absolute moral truth exists</b>; the <b>Bible is totally accurate</b> in all of the principles it teaches; Satan is considered to be a real being or force, not merely symbolic; <b>a person cannot earn their way into Heaven</b> by trying to be good or do good works; Jesus Christ lived a sinless life on earth; and God is the all-knowing, all-powerful creator of the world who still rules the universe today</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can quibble about their definition, however, most people would agree
it represents the conservative, traditional Christian view. It’s
certainly not post-modern, liberal, or progressive.</p>
<p>What did they find in responses to each question? Even if you don’t
accept their definition of “biblical worldview,” the responses provide
insights.</p>
<ul>
<li>Only 1/3 of all adults believe in absolute moral truth</li>
<li>Only half believe the Bible is accurate</li>
<li>Only 1/4 believe Satan is real</li>
<li>Only 1/4 believe you can’t earn your way into heaven</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are quite low numbers. Only one-third believe in absolute moral
truth? Pathetic. I don’t think the numbers are that low, however.</p>
<p>Tell a liberal, progressive value-relativist you want to take their car,
drain their bank account, and kick their puppy. They’ll quickly respond
that’s <em>wrong</em>.</p>
<p>Maybe for <em>you</em>, but not for <em>me</em> — I don’t believe in absolute moral
truth. Gotcha!</p>
<p>They’ll quickly change their tune, and agree absolute truth <em>does</em>
exist, they just <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/10/tactics-rebellion.html">don’t want to accept it</a>. That’s
a nice way of saying they’re in rebellion against God.</p>
<p>Those numbers paint a bad picture, but worse, the study found only 1/2%
of 18–23 year olds hold a biblical worldview.</p>
<p>Another lost generation.</p>
<p>It’s interesting to look at <a href="https://www.barna.org/barna-update/21-transformation/252-barna-survey-examines-changes-in-worldview-among-christians-over-the-past-13-years">political differences</a></p>
<ul>
<li>1% of Democrats hold a biblical worldview</li>
<li>10% of Republicans hold a biblical worldview</li>
</ul>
<p>It appears politics and religion <em>do</em> mix — conservative politics leads
to traditional orthodox Christian beliefs, while liberal politics leads
to liberal, post-modern “Christianity.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/03/atheism-poison-liberal-theology.html">liberal theology paves the way to Hell</a>,
and might be the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2014/06/the-biggest-hoax-ever-fed-to-the-church.html">biggest hoax ever fostered on the church</a>.</p>
<p>How do people end up so far from orthodox Christianity?
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/09/the-danger-of-drifting.html">Drifting</a>.
Soon you’re a liberal, then a progressive, then in rebellion against
God.</p>
<p>Youth receive training in non-biblical worldviews, beginning in
government education, and (sadly) continuing in modern churches.</p>
<p>How do we combat that?</p>
<h2>Liberal and Progressive Theology</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/11/post-modern-philosophy-church.html">Post-modernism</a>
infested the church and education, causing most of the trouble.</p>
<p>Nobody actually believes that garbage. As already said, tell a liberal,
progressive you want to take their car, drain their bank account, and
kick their puppy.</p>
<p>Nobody says that’s okay — even liberal post-modernists.</p>
<p>Thus, everyone agrees liberal post-modern philosophy contains nothing
more than doggy poo-poo — even liberals reject the insanity of
post-modernism they promote.</p>
<p>Why does it infest the church? Simple, people want the form of
godliness, but want to deny the power thereof. Simply put, they want to
<em>look</em> religious, without actually <em>being</em> religious. Brilliant!</p>
<p>Post-modernism and liberal theology to the rescue. Using those tools,
liberals can take what they like, deny what they don’t, and create their
own designer religion.</p>
<p>For a funny look using their own methods, consider <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/04/jesus-was-republican-not-democrat.html">Jesus was a Republican</a>.</p>
<p>Whatever you call it (post-modernism, liberal theology, progressivism,
value relativism), it could be the biggest evil ever introduced into the
world. You must understand it because you will encounter post-modern
people, and you need to understand how to talk to people holding such
bizarrely illogical views.</p>
<p>Young people are indoctrinated in school and church accept this garbage
— it’s up to us to introduce them to the truth.</p>
<h2>Failure of Government Education</h2>
<p>We must acknowledge the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/10/homeschooling-vs-public-education.html">failure of government education</a>.
Failure comes not from a lack of <em>money</em>, it’s a question of <em>goals</em> —
it might surprise you to learn we <em>know</em> what type of education works.
It’s called direct instruction, or “nuns in the classroom,” and has been
studied from 1965 until 1998.</p>
<p>Even the studies’ authors wonder <a href="http://pages.uoregon.edu/adiep/ft/watkins.htm">why don’t we use what works</a>?</p>
<p>Why not? Education leaders certainly hold intelligence. Replacing
systems that work with buzzwords-of-the-year (race to the top, goals
2000, no child left behind, common core, etc) leads to one conclusion:
<strong>the goal of public (government) education is not to educate</strong>.</p>
<p>Read that again — the goal of government education is <em>not</em> to educate,
and its failure is <em>not</em> from a lack of money, rather it’s the intended
end.</p>
<p>For some reason, leaders don’t <em>want</em> to provide education. It’s left to
you to discover why; while I certainly have ideas, they aren’t important
here — only the undisputed fact educational leaders fail to use methods
<em>proven</em> to work. That is unquestionable.</p>
<p>Value-relativism and atheist worldviews fill government schools,
providing no benefit, no matter what buzzword is used to describe it.</p>
<h2>The Church is Impotent</h2>
<p>Even if schools fail, the church should be educating with truth, but
sadly, not many churches proclaim truth, perhaps because they don’t know
it.</p>
<p>The average pew-warmer fails to understand the battle they’re engaged
in, leading to one of two endings: failure to engage the enemy, or (if
they do engage) slaughtered like a pig because they lack sufficient
fighting skills.</p>
<p>At 3am, you’ve got what you’ve got.</p>
<p>If your church fails to teach line by line through the entire Bible,
perhaps it’s time to find another church. Yes, that’s harsh, but you
must ask if your current situation adequately prepares you for combat.</p>
<p>First, <a href="https://framesofreferencellc.com/catalog/9780983111733/">get in the game</a>, then
<a href="https://framesofreferencellc.com/catalog/9780983111740/">stay in the game</a>.</p>
<h2>I Won’t Sit Down</h2>
<p>John Loeffler says “I won’t sit down and I won’t shut up.” It may not be
politically correct (but those people quit reading at the introduction),
but it’s time to meet garbage philosophy infesting the church head-on.</p>
<p>Liberal theology and post-modernism deceives people and teaches lies,
ending in apostasy.</p>
<p>I won’t sit down either. As said in Hosea 4:6 “My people are destroyed
for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also
reject thee.”</p>
<p>God gave you a brain — it’s time to use it to acquire necessary combat
skills.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/01/atheism.html">Atheism is illogical</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/11/post-modern-philosophy-church.html">Post-modernism is absurd</a></li>
<li>Truth exists</li>
<li>The Bible is God’s inerrant Word</li>
<li>All of God’s Word is profitable</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, we should study and follow God’s Word. All of it.</p>
<p>Not many believe these foundational principles anymore. No matter. Truth
can’t change simply because it doesn’t poll well. Are you ready to
proclaim truth and combat deception?</p>
<p>That’s where I want to help. I’ve spent a few decades studying science,
evolution, theology, and the bizarre ideas blowing through the church.</p>
<p>What can I do to help you be prepared?</p>
<p>… Because at 3AM, you’ve got what you’ve got.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
