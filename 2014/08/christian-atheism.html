  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>A bizarre liberal concept is “Christian Atheism” — the idea Jesus didn’t
really exist (and/or wasn’t God), but we should follow the <em>teachings</em>
and morals of Him, even though it’s only a fabrication. It’s
Christianity without God.</p>
<p>I have a college degree, and honestly it’s difficult to read this stuff,
because frankly, most of it makes no sense — the words put together form
sentences grammatically impossible to understand.</p>
<p>I’m reminded of a story Walter Martin told when he was in school
involving his liberal theologian professor. A scholarly article came
out, and Walter <em>tried</em> to understand it, but couldn’t as it contained
liberal-speak, so he took it to his old pal the liberal professor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sir, did you see the article in last weeks paper?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, very profound.</p>
<p>Now, sir, you know I’m a hard worker, and money doesn’t come easy for
me, but I’ll give you $100 if you can honestly tell me what this
means.</p>
<p>(professor glances at article, which Walter had marked with questions)</p>
<p>Dammed if I know!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, so much mumbo-jumbo exists it’s hard to decipher. Like the
emperor’s new clothes, many times even liberals can’t understand it, but
repeat how wonderful it is just so nobody thinks it’s complete doggy
poo-poo.</p>
<p>Christian atheism? Could two words create a bigger contradiction?</p>
<p>Thomas Altizer wrote a book “The New Gospel of Christian Atheism,” and
I’m sure it’s popular with liberals everywhere. Like Walter, I ask can
anyone explain the mumbo-jumbo?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We typically fashion our notion of anything we deem sacred “Oneness”
in anthropomorphic terms, so we can more easily relate to the idea.
The Christian then proceeds to incarnate that God notion with a
Christology in which Jesus is typically construed as a co-eternal
mediator and — peculiarly — a substitutionary sacrifice.</p>
<p>But for those progressives for whom such a construct is no longer
viable or credible, what might still be found amidst the theological
rubble in a post-modern — even post-deconstructionist — age? Indeed,
what may have been there from the start of the entire imaginative
process; known in the earliest days of a pre-Christian movement, known
simply as the Way (of Jesus)? As near as we might be able to discern
it with our own creative and interpretive imaginations, what
resemblance might such a path bear to the “voice-print” of an
extraordinarily imaginative character we might want to befriend? (John
Bennison, “Jesus, My Imaginary Friend”
http://progressivechristianity.org/resources/jesus-my-imaginary-friend/)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That reads like someone threw darts at a board filled with big words,
stringing the result together. Classic hand-waving tactics to create
distraction from the total nonsense put forward.</p>
<p>Christian atheism appears to divorce God from Jesus.</p>
<p>Why would anyone want to do this? One possible reason — some people want
to <em>appear</em> religious without actually <em>being</em> religious. For them,
Christianity without God fills the need.</p>
<p>If Jesus never existed, God can be denied. Better yet, we can construct
our own “god” and do whatever we want. Have a sin you want to continue?
Just claim passages in the Bible no longer apply, or that book
supposedly written by Paul was really a forgery, so we don’t have to
follow it.</p>
<p>What’s left? Potlucks. And an empty shell of a church was has all the
form of Christianity without the pesky problem of actually having God,
leaving the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">gospel of social justice</a>
and good works, but not sin, redemption, Hell, or Jesus as God.</p>
<p>Such movements Jude warned about.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old
ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our
God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord
Jesus Christ. (Jude 4)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>… as well as Peter</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there
shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in
damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring
upon themselves swift destruction. And many shall follow their
pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil
spoken of. (2 Peter 2:1–2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Progressive, liberal, progressive, atheist “Christianity” makes God in
man’s image.</p>
<p>Whatever you call it, it has no relation to God, it’s deception, it’s
wrong, and it deceives many people.</p>
<p>Frankly, I have more respect for the actual atheist who shakes his fist
at God and says you don’t exist, than for liberals and progressives who
like the swishing of the robes, but want nothing to do with the God of
the Bible, don’t want to follow His rules, and attempt to hide their
open rebellion and contempt for the creator of the universe.</p>
<p>You can believe the Bible, or the liberals, but not both — they
represent opposites. Liberals want everything from Christianity except God.</p>
<p>My brain hurts from all this nonsense, but I read it so you don’t have to.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
