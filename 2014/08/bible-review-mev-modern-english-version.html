<p>Bible translation remains a popular topic. Everyone wants to know which
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/01/which-bible-translation-best.html">Bible translation</a>
is best.</p>
<p>Because Bible translation yields high profit for companies, new or
updated entries continue to enter the market:
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/08/bible-review-esv.html" title="Bible Review of ESV">ESV</a>,

and so on.</p>
<p>Welcome the newest entry: the MEV, or Modern English Version.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/01/3-steps-choosing-bible-translation.html">3 steps to review Bible translations</a>,
because <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/03/qa-best-bible-translation-personal-preference.html">personal preference</a>
is not a valid way to pick a Bible — we must use consistent and
systematic methods.</p>
<p>The MEV’s claim to fame being instead of the horribly corrupt
Westcott-Hort text (also known as UBS or Nestle-Aland), it uses the
superior text behind the King James: Textus-Receptus (or the received
text), also known as the Majority text.</p>
<p>Sadly, I’ve made multiple requests for review copies and more
information, but they have failed to respond in any way (even a
refusal), so I can’t follow the normal three-step review process, I’m
relying on their <a href="http://modernenglishversion.com/comparison/">review page</a>.</p>
<h2>Hebrews 4:12</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>For the word of God is alive, and active, and sharper than any
two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, of
joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intents of the
heart. (MEV)</p>
<p>For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any
two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and
of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents
of the heart. (NKJV)</p>
<p>For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged
sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and
of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
(ESV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Powerful in the NKJV is <a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G1756&amp;t=KJV">Strong’s 1756</a>
having the flavor of energy, so powerful provides a reasonable
translation.</p>
<p>Both the ESV and MEV miss by translating “active” instead. While not
horrible, I can’t help but wonder if newer translations change words
just to be different. After all, it’s a new translation, so it can’t
read like older ones — even if they’re more accurate.</p>
<h2>Philippians 4:12–13</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I know both how to face humble circumstances and how to have
abundance. Everywhere and in all things I have learned the secret,
both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.
13 I can do all things because of Christ who strengthens me. (MEV)</p>
<p>I know how to be abased, and I know how to abound. Everywhere and in
all things I have learned both to be full and to be hungry, both to
abound and to suffer need. 13 I can do all things through Christ who
strengthens me. (NKJV)</p>
<p>I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty.
I have learned the secret of being content in every situation, whether
well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. 13 I can do
all this through him who gives me strength. (NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These verses show the MEV taking NKJV words and changing them to those
more commonly heard (abased -&gt; humble, etc). No tragic mistake here,
except for translating “because” instead of “through,” which
<a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G1722&amp;t=KJV">Strong’s</a>
notes is a preposition.</p>
<p>Changing the translation not only weakens the text, it changes the
grammar — <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/engagement/2/1/37/">“because” is a conjunction</a>, not a
preposition.</p>
<p>I had an English teacher a long time ago explain prepositions as having
a relationship with a box — you can be near, to, above, below, at,
through, or many other things spatially relating to a box.</p>
<p>You can’t be “because” a box — it’s not a preposition.</p>
<p>Leaving grammar aside, a large difference exists between doing something
<em>because</em> of Christ, and <em>through</em> Christ. The first implies you can
perform it on your own power, while the second does not.</p>
<p>Knowing what you know about your relationship with God and your ability
and His, which do you think makes sense? You don’t need to be a Greek or
textual scholar to choose.</p>
<p>Why they changed this is mysterious.</p>
<h2>Can the MEV Replace the KJV, NKJV, ESV, Or NIV?</h2>
<p>The MEV appears as a cross between the KJV textual foundation and the
ESV style. If you like so-called modern translations style and
vocabulary, but don’t like corrupt Westcott-Hort texts, it appears
you’ll like the MEV.</p>
<p>If you’re used to the KJV, you won’t find anything to move you away from
the venerated and still undisputed champ — <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2008/03/why-kjv-best-bible-translation.html">King James</a>
and New King James.</p>
<p>I’ll hold off final review until (or <em>if</em>) they decide to provide the
information I’ve requested from them.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
