  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>I really hate saying that. But I’ve watched political and religious
events for decades, and what happens today isn’t something which just
sprang up, it’s something brewing for a long time.</p>
<p>Outrage appeared this week at Houston’s attempt to subpoena sermons and
notes of pastors, who might have said something the city didn’t like.</p>
<p>Sadly, it’s neither an isolated event, nor the only issue on the table,
but let’s deal with Houston’s mistake first.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.chron.com/news/politics/houston/article/Parker-calls-ERO-sermon-supboeana-overly-broad-5824816.php">
<p>Amid outrage from religious groups, Mayor Annise Parker and City Attorney David Feldman on Wednesday appeared to back off a subpoena request for the sermons of certain ministers opposed to the city’s equal rights ordinance, with Parker calling it overly broad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice they didn’t say <em>wrong</em>, just overly broad. It’s a typical
non-apology apology.</p>
<p>They passed the blame to an outside attorney’s office, with the mayor
saying she hadn’t seen the document until this week.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Let me just say that one word in a very long legal document which I
know nothing about and would never have read and I’m vilified coast to
coast,” Parker said. “It’s a normal day at the office for me.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sorry ma’am, you’re (supposed to be) in charge of these people. They
work in your name, on your behalf. Failure for you to know what actions
your people take does not absolve you of responsibility, and trying to
portray yourself as the victim is pathetic.</p>
<p>Whatever happened to “the buck stops here”?</p>
<p>Looking at the bigger picture, not only this episode, but what happens
all over the world — eliminating a group you deem “undesirable” always —
always — uses the same methods.</p>
<p>To silence a group, follow these simple steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify the group.</li>
<li>Vilify the group.</li>
<li>Pass laws to restrict the group.</li>
<li>Enforce the law.</li>
</ol>
<p>In Houston’s case, they’ve already accomplished 1—3, but had to
backtrack once the effort at the last step was noticed.</p>
<p>Backtrack, but not repent or admit wrong.</p>
<p>It’s a new tactic: <em>lawfare</em> — using legal processes to silence people
you don’t think should speak.</p>
<p>Consider your local pastor sued or brought to trial for something a
government entity doesn’t like.</p>
<p>How many could spend tens (or hundreds) of thousands of dollars
defending against obvious violations of the Constitution?</p>
<p>In the new lawfare strategy, deep-pocketed groups <em>know</em> they’ll lose at
trial, but that’s not the point. The point is to make it so painful, so
expensive, so burdensome to exercise your rights you simply won’t do so.</p>
<p>The right may still exist on paper, but it’s of no practical use.</p>
<p>Never forget, rights do <em>not</em> come from the government. They’re
God-given, and government should <em>protect</em> those rights.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of
Happiness.—That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted
among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed
…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A tragic misunderstanding swept the country in the last few years
(mainly because so few people ever <em>read</em> the founding documents) —
people believe government grants rights.</p>
<p>Not so. Those rights are granted by God, and government should <em>protect</em>
those rights.</p>
<ul>
<li>Free Speech</li>
<li>Freedom of religion</li>
<li>Freedom in your personal effects and papers</li>
</ul>
<p>People might celebrate the city of Houston has (at least temporarily)
backed down, but know this: groups desiring to silence Christians and
others <em>will never stop</em>, admit wrong, or change course.</p>
<p>They’re in it for the long haul to fundamentally transform the country
(and the world) — that’s not tin-foil hat paranoia, they openly shout it
for all to hear.</p>
<p>They simply wait until another opportunity presents itself, and when it
does, the protest becomes smaller as people become less vigilant.</p>
<p>I’ve been warning about these things for decades, and sadly few have
heeded the warning.</p>
<p>In other news, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/10/07/dea-created-a-fake-facebook-profile-in-this-womans-name-using-seized-pics-then-impersonated-her/">DEA agents impersonated a woman</a>
with information found on her phone, creating a Facebook profile and
using it in an attempt to entrap drug dealers.</p>
<p>At the very least, those DEA agents violated several laws, in addition
to putting her life in danger.</p>
<ul>
<li>Published photos without holding copyright.</li>
<li>Identify theft.</li>
</ul>
<p>Incredibly, the DEA <em>in court</em> defended the practice, saying the woman
consented to these illegal activities by allowing the police to look at
her phone.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Imagine if you downloaded music on your phone illegally. When brought to
court, you said the artist and record label consented to your posting
songs on your web site, because you looked at the CD in the store.</p>
<p>How far do you think you’d get with that?</p>
<p>These events are not tinfoil hat paranoia, simply read what goes on. All
the parties <em>admit</em> what they did, they simply don’t think they did
anything wrong, Constitution be dammed.</p>
<p>These activities are not conducted in the shadows, it’s all a matter of
public record.</p>
<p>If you are a Bible believing Christian, you will increasingly become
more and more reviled, and more and more targeted for silence,
ironically all in the name of “tolerance.”</p>
<p>History demonstrates what most of the world has endured, for most of the
last 2,000 years. What makes the United States immune?</p>
<p>As for myself, I’ll continue to do exactly what I’ve done — teach the
Word — for as long as possible.</p>
<p>You must decide for yourself how you’ll respond — as history shows,
these things usually get worse.</p>
<p>… because it’s 2:59AM</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
