  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Popular culture (“Christmas card theology”) creates widely accepted
ideas about Biblical events. The rapture might be the most misunderstood
of those — images of people flying up in the air might be popular, but
they’re not true.</p>
<p>It turns out Paul explained <em>exactly</em> how fast the rapture occurs, if
you’re willing to dig a little.</p>
<p>But we’re getting ahead of ourselves. We’ll need a small diversion in
Physics first.</p>
<h2>What is Time?</h2>
<p>People misunderstand time, using the terms <em>analog</em> and <em>digital</em>
without understanding what they mean.</p>
<p>Analog creates images of an old LP record or cassette tape.</p>
<p>Analog recordings are created as some device records sound waves on a
physical medium (tape, vinyl), and another device takes those patterns
and recreates them as sound.</p>
<p>Digital, on the other hand, encodes in binary form — 0 or 1 (1 + 1 = 10,
at least in base 2).</p>
<p>Those files can be encoded by a computer, and the resulting files can be
passed around wirelessly, like iTunes, for example.</p>
<p>Analog versus digital can be viewed as two kinds of watches. One has a
second hand continually sweeping out in constant motion. You watch it
move from 1 second, to 1.5 seconds, and then to 2 seconds.</p>
<p>Digital uses a second hand which “clicks” from one second to the other.
It moves, then stops, then moves. It’s either a second, or it’s not. It
looks like an old stop-motion movie.</p>
<p>It might surprise you to learn <em>no such thing as analog exists</em> — the
world is <em>entirely</em> digital. To understand that we must discover the
Planck time.</p>
<h2>Planck Time</h2>
<p>Along with <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/01/frames-reference.html">Einstein’s Relativity</a>
we discovered quantum Physics — the world is <em>not</em> analog as we think,
it’s digital.</p>
<p>Simply put, we live in a giant stop-motion production. Time is not
continuous, but digital, moving in small, but discrete, amounts.</p>
<p>What is that amount? 10<sup>–43</sup> seconds. If we return to the watch picture,
the second hand moves 10<sup>43</sup> times per second.</p>
<p>Yes, that’s impossible to see, and to observers it appears as if time
moves continuously in an analog manner.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t.</p>
<p>The important discovery to grasp is <em>nothing</em> exists in between those
steps — units of time smaller than 10<sup>–43</sup> seconds simply don’t exist.</p>
<p>That’s hard to understand, so let’s move to something which might be a
bit easier conceptually. It turns out a similar situation exists with
length as well.</p>
<p>The Planck length measures roughly 10<sup>–35</sup> meters. For reference, a
proton (one of this thingys inside an atom) measures roughly 10<sup>–15</sup>
meters.</p>
<p>So we’re talking <em>really</em> small length here.</p>
<p>So what? Suppose you took a sheet of paper, and cut it in half. Then in
half again. In theory, we’d imagine we could do this forever, making
smaller and smaller pieces.</p>
<p>That’s not true.</p>
<p>When you get to the Planck length (10<sup>–35</sup> meters), it’s impossible to
divide it again; units of smaller length don’t exist.</p>
<h2>The Rapture</h2>
<p>What does all this Planck stuff have to do with the rapture? In one
passage, Paul states we’ll all be changed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all
be changed, In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last
trump; for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised
incorruptible, and we shall be changed. (1 Corinthians 15:51–52)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word Paul uses for <em>moment</em> is
<a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G823&amp;t=KJV">atomos</a>.</p>
<p>Ah ha! Oh wait, I still don’t get it — you might not see the
significance unless you know how atom was defined.</p>
<p>The Greeks believed atoms were the smallest thing which could exist (we
know that’s not true, inside atoms are protons, neutrons, electrons,
quarks, and a host of other stuff), in other words atoms are
<em>indivisible</em>.</p>
<p>See it now? Paul says the rapture occurs in an <em>indivisible</em> length of
time. Today we know what that is, it’s the Planck time, or 10<sup>–43</sup>
seconds.</p>
<p>That’s fast.</p>
<h2>Practical implications</h2>
<p>That may all be academic so far, so consider some practical
implications.</p>
<p>It’s a year from the rapture, and the people left behind are trying to
figure out what happened. They have advanced equipment, but nobody can
figure out where millions of people went, leaving only a pile of clothes
behind.</p>
<p>Suppose they used a super high speed camera. Normal motion pictures are
16–32 frames per second — movies are nothing more than individual
pictures rapidly shown, which appear to display motion.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever created a flip-book or stop-motion movies (like Gumby),
you see how this works. In the old days with film, you could unroll and
actually see the images.</p>
<p>So future-world tries to figure out what happened. But they can’t.</p>
<p>Why not? Similar to a stop-motion film, they have no information on what
occurred <em>between</em> the frames — it is <em>unknowable</em> to them.</p>
<p>If they had equipment with the fastest possible speed, they still could
not see anything, because in one frame you’re there, the next you’re
gone — in an <em>atom</em> of time, as Paul says.</p>
<p>No matter how hard they try, it won’t be possible for future-world to
determine what happened, until, that is, they discover an old dusty
book, and some guy named Paul.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, my crazy old man used to talk about him, and a strange book
detailing future events. Maybe I should take a look at that…</p>
<h2>So What?</h2>
<p>Admittedly, this doesn’t have much practical use (unless you’re one of
those left behind), other than being in awe at how Paul could have
understood quantum Physics, thousands of years before Einstein was born.</p>
<p>Paul 1, skeptics 0.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
