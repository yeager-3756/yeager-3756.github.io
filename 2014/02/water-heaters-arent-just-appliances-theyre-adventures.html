  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Our town’s water is legendary for its badness. It’s hard as a rock, and
tends to eat through almost anything, leaving brown stains and
disintegrated metal behind. It’s not unsafe, but not very appealing
either, containing lots of iron and minerals.</p>
<p><img class="svg-resize floatleft" src="/images/generic/faucet-dollars.svgz" width="165" height="258" /></p>
<p>As a result, we tend to go through appliances a lot. Our two-year-old
water-heater’s anode rod has already disintegrated.</p>
<p>Not a hard job to replace it, I thought. I can do this in an hour or
two.</p>
<p>Not so fast, mon ami.</p>
<p>Strangely, the rod didn’t have a hex fitting for a wrench, it was
completely round. No problem, I’ll grab a pipe wrench.</p>
<p>Naturally, the pipe wrench wasn’t to be found in the tool box, so down
to the hardware store and $10 later I’ve got a new pipe wrench. Ready
to go, this will be an hour or so.</p>
<p>Not so fast, mon ami.</p>
<p>I <em>leaned</em> on that thing, and it wouldn’t budge.</p>
<h3>Enter the Plumber</h3>
<p>Finally, I gave up and called the plumber. $275 later, he had it fixed
(along with a new thermostat and other parts).</p>
<p>Of course, that’s not the end of the story — did I mention our water is
a bit bad?</p>
<p>We flushed the water heater, and a pile of sand came out — just like
you’d find on the beach. No problem, we got it all out, let’s refill the
tank and we’re done.</p>
<p>Not so fast, mon ami.</p>
<p>It worked … for a few minutes. Then the kitchen faucet plugged up.
Completely. As in not even a drip.</p>
<p>No big deal, we’ll just take it apart and clean it out.</p>
<p>Not so fast, mon ami.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t clean out. Nada. Zip. Now we need a new hose; everyone pile
into the car and off we go.</p>
<h3>Computer Guys are like Doctors</h3>
<p>I’m a computer network administrator and programmer. Computer guys are
like doctors and lawyers, as soon as people discover what you do they
ask for help.</p>
<p>On this day I was supposed to assist a friend getting a USB wi-fi card
working. We had to cancel because of the water-heater adventure (which
was only supposed to take an hour).</p>
<p>Since we had to saddle up the horses and ride into town, I figured we’d
stop by so I could at least accomplish <em>something</em> today. Besides, I
gave my word.</p>
<p>They worked on it for <em>hours</em> and accomplished nothing. I’ve done
<em>hundreds</em> of setups like this, we’ll be done in a few minutes.</p>
<p>Just that fast, mon ami — I had that thing working in five minutes.
Flat.</p>
<h3>The Rest of the Story</h3>
<p>We’re still holding the #@$! plugged-up hose, and after telling our
sad story, he’s a contractor … with an air compressor … in the garage.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you let me see if I can blow it out,” he said. Sure, you can
<em>try</em>, but we’ve been working on it for a while, and it’s totally
plugged.</p>
<p>He had that thing working in five minutes. Flat.</p>
<h2>You’re Special … But Don’t Get Cocky</h2>
<p>Nobody’s good at everything, but everyone is good at something.</p>
<p>One of our friends noticed someone is stealing their firewood, and in
Oregon that’s like horse stealing in the wild west. It’s not very nice,
and can get you in a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>She posted if they just asked she would have given wood to them (she’s
that kind of person), and a loaf of bread as well (she’s quite the
legendary cook).</p>
<p>After reading that, I was compelled to confess. Yep, it was me — can I
have my bread now?</p>
<p>I’m sure soon after, a flood of confessions poured in. Everyone wanted
that bread. Yeah, it’s <em>that</em> good.</p>
<h2>Pay it Forward</h2>
<p>An old movie from 2000 called “Pay it Forward” never really became
popular, but contained the idea when someone does something for you,
don’t worry about paying it <em>back</em>, but pay it <em>forward</em> — do something
for someone else who needs help.</p>
<p>Every Christian has at least <em>one</em> spiritual gift.</p>
<p>Isn’t it time we started using those and paying it forward? Many in the
church have situations they need help with, and while they’re
floundering around it could be you’re the person to help.</p>
<p>In five minutes. Flat.</p>
<p>It’s time to <a href="https://framesofreferencellc.com/catalog/9780983111733/">get in the game</a>, as you
have unique gifts nobody else has, and if you’re not using them you’re
jipping the rest of us of something God wants us to have.</p>
<p>If that last thought didn’t jar you a bit, you need to re-read it.</p>
<p>We have people gifted in teaching, music, exhortation, administration,
helps, and a whole lot of other areas.</p>
<p>The problem comes when those people <em>fail to recognize their gift</em>. How
can someone miss it? It’s so natural to them, they don’t think of it as
anything special.</p>
<p>But if you’re the guy struggling with the spiritual equivalent of a USB
wi-fi card or a messed up plumbing hose, you realize those abilities are
<em>not</em> normal — they’ve been given by God who <em>intends them to be used</em>.</p>
<p>Take your gift, and pay it forward.</p>
<p>Yes, life is hard, and <a href="https://framesofreferencellc.com/catalog/9780983111740/">you might not get a pony</a>, but it’s
the fourth quarter, and we don’t have much time left.</p>
<p>Don’t you want to get off the bench and get in the game?</p>
<h2>So What?</h2>
<p>I’ve picked up quite a few new
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/page/newsletter.html">subscribers</a> in the last few
months, and let me restate what <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/page/about.html">I’ve said before</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Too many Christians face trials and crisis, and when they look in
their toolbox for something to use, they find nothing. We want to
change that.</p>
<p>Our goal is to make this your go-to reference for filling your
toolbox. Because <strong>you will have those 3AM moments</strong>, the only
question will be how you handle them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With that in mind, it’s time to remind everyone — what can we do for
you? What questions do you have, what doctrine bothers you, what do you
<em>really</em> need an answer for, but don’t want to ask?</p>
<p>It’s time to ask … because it’s 2:59AM.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
