  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>I read many blogs and news sites. Political, conservative, liberal,
theological, atheist, science, and more. It’s important to be
well-rounded and consider ideas from different views you might not have
considered before. In doing so, I discover a lot of rather strange
stuff, really off-the-wall tin-foil hat kinds of things.</p>
<p>I’ve seen comments about telling people they’re sinners isn’t part of
the gospel. Let’s just looooove each other, and be tolerant of
alternative lifestyles — hey brother, I’m glad that heroin thing is
working for you — as if you can’t love someone <em>unless</em> you accept and
promote whatever they’re doing (even if it causes their death, earthly
and eternally).</p>
<p>Garbage.</p>
<p>If someone is on the train tracks, <strong>I’ll use whatever means necessary
to get them off to safety, and worry about “offending” them later</strong>. I’m
not going to accept standing on the train tracks as a healthy and
correct lifestyle — they’ll <em>die</em>.</p>
<h2>What is the Gospel?</h2>
<p>Fortunately it’s not hard to understand the Gospel, and it’s not open
for discussion of alternate definitions. It’s a matter of undeniable
fact.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to
you, which also you received and in which you stand (1 Corinthians
15:1 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, so nobody can argue, Paul tells you <em>what</em> he’s going to tell you
— the Gospel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He
was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the
Scriptures (1 Corinthians 15:3 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If someone says telling people they’re sinners in need of a savior isn’t
the Gospel, they’re placing themselves above Paul — move over Paul,
you’re wrong and I’m going to fix your mistake.</p>
<p>The Gospel remains simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Man is a sinner.</li>
<li>Christ died for our sins.</li>
<li>Christ rose again.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Shock! Horror!</h2>
<p>All other feel-good ideas are <em>not</em> the gospel, and take away from it.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/01/shifting-sands-of-post-modern-philosophy.html">Denying absolute truth</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/09/was-early-church-socialist.html">Wealth redistribution</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">Social Justice</a></li>
<li>Building homes for homeless</li>
<li>Potlucks</li>
</ul>
<p>Even more, <em>Jesus’ life can not save you</em>.</p>
<p>What? Neither can His miracles, teaching, or example. <strong>If the church
wastes time on feel-good ideas, you’re insuring hell will be
well-populated.</strong></p>
<p>It’s <em>vital</em> for people to understand they’re sinners, and only one way
exists for the penalty that sin requires to be paid — Christ’s atoning
death on the cross.</p>
<h2>Attack of the Heretics</h2>
<p>If someone tries to re-define the Gospel to something else, they’re
heretics — meaning at odds with established doctrine (i.e. Paul).</p>
<p>It might be <em>popular</em> today to add fads like social justice, good works,
potlucks, and so on, but they are <em>not</em> the gospel.</p>
<p>That’s not my idea, it’s Paul’s.</p>
<p>Paul also includes a warning about those who appear and attempt to
change definitions of the Gospel. After all, if you don’t have the
atoning death of Christ, you’re filling the corners of hell.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am shocked that you are turning away so soon from God, who called
you to himself through the loving mercy of Christ. You are following a
different way that pretends to be the Good News but is not the Good
News at all. You are being fooled by those who deliberately twist the
truth concerning Christ. <strong>Let God’s curse fall on anyone, including
us or even an angel from heaven, who preaches a different kind of Good
News than the one we preached to you.</strong> I say again what we have said
before: If anyone preaches any other Good News than the one you
welcomed, let that person be cursed. (Galatians 1:6–9 NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What Gospel did Paul preach? Christ died for our sins. He was buried. He
rose again the third day.</p>
<h2>I Will Not Shut Up</h2>
<p>I know the preceding bothers some people. I understand. But we must move
away from worrying about not feeling good, and get back on the solid
rock of God’s Word. Substituting a phony gospel for the real is <em>not</em> a
good idea.</p>
<p>Paul warned people would appear who deliberately twist the truth, and
since the Gospel is so clearly defined, it’s hard to believe their
efforts aren’t intentional.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… Whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning
from me. If I say to the wicked, ‘You shall surely die,’ and you give
him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, in
order to save his life, that wicked person shall die for his iniquity,
but his blood I will require at your hand. (Ezekiel 3:17–18 NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t want to be guilty of failing to warn about heretical substitute
gospels, especially since the Gospel is so perfectly and obviously
stated by Paul — it’s not even <em>close</em> to a gray area.</p>
<p>People don’t like to hear the truth; they would rather feel good about
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/09/matrix-guide-christianity.html">being deceived</a>.</p>
<p>It’s time to upset the apple cart — absolute truth exists. Paul defined
the Gospel. Other substitutes are heresy. Truth doesn’t change, doesn’t
need to be “moderinized” or transformed for today’s culture.</p>
<p>If you get the Gospel right, everything follows. Get it wrong, and it’s
likely everything else will be wrong as well.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
