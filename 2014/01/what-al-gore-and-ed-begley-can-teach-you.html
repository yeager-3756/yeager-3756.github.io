  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>No matter what you think about <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/04/global-warming-logic.html">global warming</a>,
everyone agrees Al Gore remains a polarizing figure promoting his global
warming dogma. Surprisingly, the Goracle provides valuable lessons
applicable to your Christian life, and shows global warming isn’t all
hot air.</p>
<h2>The Goracle</h2>
<p>Al Gore preaches to his disciples about global warming, and the urgent
problem — we must do something <em>now</em> or the planet will die. Stop
driving, conserve energy, private jets are evil, SUV’s kill baby
kittens, and so on.</p>
<p>Yet he travels on private jets, uses considerable energy in his home,
and purchased an ocean-front mansion in California.</p>
<p>Wait, aren’t the oceans supposed to rise and flood the coasts?</p>
<p>It’s obvious Al Gore believes <em>nothing</em> of what he preaches to his
followers — it’s for public consumption by gullible people only. If the
earth hangs in the balance (as he preaches), why does he act the way he
does?</p>
<p>Simple truth — he doesn’t believe in global warming or anything else he
spouts. <em>Do as I say, not as I do</em>, or conservation for thee, but not
for me.</p>
<h2>Hypocrisy</h2>
<p>There’s a word for that — hypocrisy. As Wikipedia notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hypocrisy is the state of falsely claiming to possess virtuous
characteristics that one lacks. Hypocrisy involves the deception of
others and is thus a kind of lie.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word comes from actors playing a role — it’s not the real person,
only a fake persona intended to incite emotional responses.</p>
<h2>Ed Begley</h2>
<p>On the other hand, Ed Begley deserves respect as one of those rare
celebrities following what he believes. He’s a true environmentalist who
drives a Prius, composts, and (according to Wikipedia) lives in a modest
1,585 square foot home, powered by solar and wind, such that his
<em>yearly</em> electric bill is $300.</p>
<p>$300? <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/national_world&amp;id=5072659">ABC Local 13</a>
reports Al Gore in his 20-room mansion uses <em>100 times</em> that amount, for
a yearly total of $30,000, more than twenty times the national average.</p>
<p>No matter if you agree with Ed Begly or not, at least <a href="http://onbegleystreet.com/bios/">he walks the talk</a>; blowhards don’t (isn’t all that
hot air bad for mother earth?).</p>
<p>Both Ed Begley and the Goracle call themselves environmentalists, one
believes what he says, the other doesn’t.</p>
<h2>The Lesson</h2>
<p>You might have heard complaints about the church being full of
hypocrites. It’s the same problem so-called environmentalists have
screeching “save the planet” — just before they takeoff in their private
jet, spewing untold amounts of toxic CO2 into the atmosphere. Oh the
humanity!</p>
<p>It’s easy to shout Praise the Lord on Sunday, but live like Satan on
Monday.</p>
<p>Hypocrisy can infect anyone, at any time. Once hypocrisy becomes known,
it’s difficult to get respect back.</p>
<p>Your Christian attitude should be hypocrisy-free, as Ed Begley, not like
others who fail to act the way they say everyone should.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean you never make mistakes — I’m sure Ed Begley sometime
in the past year neglected to recycle something, or forgot to turn off
the (LED) lights.</p>
<p>The challenge for the new year — live the rest of the days like you do
on Sunday from 10AM–Noon. We all make mistakes, we all at times behave
in a manner that is not Christ-like.</p>
<p>But is it your <em>nature</em>, or a stumble? People <em>are</em> watching, and
frankly make fun of the Goracle and hypocrisy.</p>
<p>As Glenn Beck said in his newsletter about 2014 resolutions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will serve more than I am served. I will help more people in need. I
will be less cynical and highlight as many stories of decency, hope,
and love as I can find. I will be an encouragement to others rather
than a stumbling block. I will love my neighbor as myself.</p>
<p>I’m as guilty as the next guy for falling short on these simple
things. But this year, I’m recommitting myself. And I firmly believe,
if we all do the same, we can expect to see the Lord work wonders
among us in 2014.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Be like Ed, because it really comes down to a simple idea — do you
really believe what you say, or not? Do your actions on Monday match—or
oppose—your appearance on Sunday?</p>
<p>Make 2014 the year the difference between those gets smaller.</p>
<p>… Because it’s 2:59AM.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
