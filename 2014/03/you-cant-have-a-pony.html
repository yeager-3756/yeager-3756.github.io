  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Well, as it turns out, you <em>can</em>.</p>
<p>While visiting the Tatums (Lindsey wrote the foreword for my book <a href="https://framesofreferencellc.com/catalog/9780983111740/">Stay in the Game, but you still don’t get a pony</a>) I managed
to stay on a horse for 10 minutes or so without falling off (a real
horse, not the one in front of Walmart).</p>
<p>That’s a <em>big</em> deal.</p>
<p><img class="floatleft" src="https://framesofreferencellc.com/images/catalog/9780983111740.jpg" height="300" width="200" /></p>
<p>I’m not so <em>afraid</em> of horses — I’ve always been an animal lover — but
<strong>I don’t like looking stupid</strong>. With little knowledge of horses, that
was highly probable.</p>
<p>I’m much happier working on Quantum Mechanics, sparring a black-belt in
Taekwondo, or fixing a complicated computer network than going eye to
eye with a large animal.</p>
<p>I’d guess most people feel the same. <strong>Nobody likes to look foolish.</strong></p>
<p>That’s the problem. We spend so much time trying to look good, on Sunday
when asked how we’re doing we instantly transform into Tony the Tiger —
everything is grrrrrrrreat!</p>
<p>Lies.</p>
<p>Hypocrite might be a better term. The
<a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G5273&amp;t=KJV">Greek</a>
means an actor, or someone wearing a mask.</p>
<p><strong>Are you a hypocrite on Sunday?</strong> You are if you’re playing Tony the
Tiger.</p>
<p>On occasion I’ve called people out on it. It’s brutal, but <strong>you have to
(kindly) call them a liar</strong> to their face.</p>
<p>We use “how you doing” as a conversation starter, similar to what’s the
weather tomorrow, instead of a sincere inquiry.</p>
<p>That needs to change on <em>both</em> sides.</p>
<p>The person asking shouldn’t be asking if they don’t really want to know,
and the person responding should do the courtesy of not lying to their
face.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean you can (or should) spill your guts every time. It’s
okay to say I don’t want (or can’t) talk about it right now.</p>
<p>But <strong>at least be honest</strong>. I’m hurting. Life stinks.</p>
<p>As I wrote on the <a href="https://framesofreferencellc.com/catalog/9780983111740/">back cover of the book</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy
and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice
cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and
frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian
life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into
Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! But everyone needs help
sometimes.</p>
<p>A simple, but difﬁcult, cure comes from a stiff shot of reality — God
is not a genie granting wishes, life is hard, and you may not get a
pony. If you’re not resting, it’s time to take a good look at the
letter to the Hebrews, as Paul provides warning after warning about
the mineﬁeld you must pass through. Paul motivates the troops to not
abandon what they know to be true, and stay in the game, even when
(not if) adversity strikes.</p>
<p>When tough times come, you’ll look down in your toolbox and discover
either many tools to ﬁght with, or a mocking echo from the empty box,
because at 3am you’ve got what you’ve got.</p>
<p>… And it’s 2:59am.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Grab the book from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/098311174X/">Amazon.com</a>,
<a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/books/e/9780983111740/">Barnes and Noble</a>, <a href="http://mkt.com/frames-of-reference-llc/stay-in-the-game">direct from thepublisher</a>, and
all the usual places.</p>
<p><strong>If you’re registered with my
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/page/newsletter.html">newsletter</a>, you can log on to the
members-only area and download a <em>free</em> chapter</strong>. If you’re not in the
members group, <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/page/newsletter.html">sign up today</a>.</p>
<p>How often have you seen a horse with a bright pink cast? If you don’t
know the story, grab the free download and find out.</p>
<p><strong>I wouldn’t believe the first three pages</strong> of the book if I didn’t
know the people involved. <strong>It makes Job look like he won the lottery</strong>.</p>
<p>If you’re having problems, a study of Paul’s letter to the Hebrews (also
known as Stay in the Game) is in order. So in the spirit of
anti-hypocrisy, I’m going to try the horse thing again (maybe this time
at Walmart — just kidding Lindsey).</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ll probably not know what I’m doing.</li>
<li>I’ll probably look foolish.</li>
<li>I’ll make sure no YouTube video can surface.</li>
</ul>
<p>But (as Peggy reminds me), if I’m going to <em>teach</em> something, I’d better
be <em>living</em> it as well.</p>
<p>Crap. I hate it when she reminds me of that.</p>
<p>So I’m off to get a pair of boots — I’m told it makes you look better
while being dragged behind the horse after falling off.</p>
<p>Hopefully I won’t find out if that pearl of wisdom is true.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
