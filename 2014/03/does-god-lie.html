<p>If I invited you for pizza, yet served sandwiches, would you be happy,
or feel ripped off?</p>
<p>Then I tell you, it’s just a liberal view of pizza. I didn’t lie or try
to deceive you, but we need a more modern view of pizza for the 21st
century. Liberal pizza leads to the following question:</p>
<p><strong>Does your pastor reject Christianity as he stands in the pulpit?</strong></p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/06/the-cult-of-liberal-theology.html">liberal theology</a>
infests — and that’s the correct term — the church, it always begins
denying the Bible, and ends in illogical inconsistency.</p>
<p>For those claiming the Bible contains the Word of God, but isn’t perfect
or error-free, they’ve got some ’splaining to do.</p>
<p>First question, <strong>does God lie?</strong></p>
<p>Liberal theology <em>requires</em> God to lie by denying clear Bible
statements, thus God lied to you (since liberals are right and God
isn’t), and thus you can’t be sure what is true and what isn’t.</p>
<h2>Did God Lie to Noah?</h2>
<p>Some claim Noah’s flood in Genesis only occurred locally, not globally
over the whole earth.</p>
<p>Really? Let’s go to the official’s booth for a review — what does the
Bible say?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus I establish My covenant with you: Never again shall all flesh be
cut off by the waters of the flood; <strong>never again shall there be a
flood to destroy the earth</strong>. (Genesis 9:11 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The earth has endured <em>many</em> local (and quite devastating) floods. If
liberals deny the global nature of Noah’s flood, God lied to Noah and
broke His promise; His Word isn’t worth doggy poo-poo.</p>
<p>You might want to keep that ark around, Noah, another flood could be
coming … for those taking a “progressive” view of Genesis.</p>
<h2>Did God Lie to Israel?</h2>
<p>Next up is <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/03/heresy-replacement-theology.html">replacement theology</a>
— the idea the church has replaced Israel — an idea so absurd it’s
stunning anyone would accept such nonsense.</p>
<p>Yet many do.</p>
<p>What does the Bible say?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city,
to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make
reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting
righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint
the most Holy. (Daniel 9:24)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two things should be immediately obvious in this passage:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s <em>Jewish</em>, not Gentile — speaking to Daniel, <em>thy</em> people
(Jews).</li>
<li>It’s not complete — end of sin, everlasting righteousness, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Without detailing the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/01/seventy-weeks-daniel.html">70 weeks of
Daniel</a>,
it’s obvious God still has plans for Israel, thus replacement theology
is 100% wrong.</p>
<p>Unless God lies.</p>
<h2>Did Paul Lie?</h2>
<p>One idea running around liberal/progressive theology involves Easter and
the idea Christ didn’t actually resurrect in a body.</p>
<p>First, what does Paul say?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some
among you that there is no resurrection of the dead? But if there be
no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: And if Christ
be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.
Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have
testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if
so be that the dead rise not. (1 Corinthians 15)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now the progressive doubletalk:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://johnshelbyspong.com/sample-essays/the-resurrection/" title="Easter: In Need of Reinterpretation!">
<p>Fundamentalists are quite sure of their truth. On Easter the crucified Jesus, who was laid in the grave as a deceased man on Good Friday, was by the mighty act of God, restored to life on Easter. He had thus broken the power of death for all people. If the body of Jesus was not physically restored to life, the fundamentalists claim, then Easter is fraudulent.</p> 
<p>Paul, for example, writing between the years 50 and 64 or some 20 to 34 years after the earthly life of Jesus came to an end, <strong>never describes the resurrection of Jesus as a physical body resuscitated after death. There is no hint in the Pauline corpus</strong> that one, who had died, later walked out of his grave clothes, emerged from the tomb and was seen by his disciples. [emphasis added]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a quick side note, notice the first line says “their truth,” a
classic
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/11/post-modern-philosophy-church.html">post-modern</a>
view of <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2013/06/truth-isnt-relative.html">relative truth</a>,
where you can believe 2+2=4 and I — at the same time — can believe 2+2=5
and we <em>both</em> can hold “truth.”</p>
<p><strong>Truth is not relative, and it changes not.</strong></p>
<p>Again, let’s go to the booth for a review, in this case, what did Paul
actually say?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he
was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the
scriptures: And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: After
that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the
greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.
After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles. And last
of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time. (1
Corinthians 15)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m a simple guy, granted, I’m not a “scholar,” but I see no way to
reconcile the first quote with the second.</p>
<p>Progressive theology says Paul never even <em>hints</em> of the physical
resurrection, yet Paul says exactly the opposite, in fact <em>begging</em> his
readers to check the facts out for themselves.</p>
<p>Paul refers to the apostles seeing Jesus; recall a familiar passage from
Luke:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see;
<strong>for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have</strong>. (Luke
24:39)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can only guess liberal scholars’ Bibles are missing 1 Corinthians 15
and Luke 24.</p>
<p>And of course, the review booth also notes the words of Jesus Himself
(who, after all, ought to know):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three
days I will raise it up. Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was
this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days? But
he spoke of the temple of his body. (John 2:19–21)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Body in Greek is <a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G4983">Strong’s G4983</a>,
and it means exactly as it reads: the physical body.</p>
<p>Who is this person offering a contrary view from the Bible? It’s Bishop
Spong, whose home page declares:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For those seeking to experience Christianity in a new and vibrant way,
Bishop John Shelby Spong offers fresh spiritual ideas. Over the past
four decades, he has become <strong>one of the definitive voices for
progressive Christianity</strong>. [emphasis added]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does Bishop Spong say about Easter, if it’s not the resurrection?</p>
<blockquote cite="http://johnshelbyspong.com/sample-essays/the-resurrection/" title="Easter: In Need of Reinterpretation!">
<p>What Paul does suggest is that Easter meant that God had acted to reverse the verdict that the world had pronounced on Jesus by raising Jesus from death into God. It was, therefore, out of God in a transforming kind of heavenly vision that this Jesus then appeared to certain chosen witnesses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I honestly could testify under oath I have no idea what that means, but
then, I’m a simple guy.</p>
<h2>Liberalism Fails, not God</h2>
<p>The Bible claims <em>all</em> of it is profitable and inspired by God. You can
trust <em>all</em> of it … unless God lies. I may be out in left field, but I
believe lies aren’t profitable for anything.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for
doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
righteousness (2 Timothy 3:16)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All means all, that’s all all means.</p>
<p>If liberals are correct, God lied numerous times, and so did Paul to
Timothy.</p>
<p>If liberal theology is true, what can you believe from the Bible? <strong>Can
you pick and choose what to accept and what to reject?</strong> Liberal
theology allows you to do just that.</p>
<p>Want to cheat on your wife? Just toss out sections on adultery. They’re
so confining, and clearly not meant for today’s society when web sites
use slogans like “life is short, have an affair,” and providing 7 habits
of successful cheaters.</p>
<p>Surely Paul couldn’t imagine modern society, so sections about adultery
and immorality don’t apply today. <em>If it feels good, do it.</em></p>
<p><strong>You’re free to do as you wish</strong>, of course, but don’t be deceived
thinking the Bible no longer applies, or worse, that God approves of
your iniquity, rebellion, and sin when He specifically laid out His
views in black and white.</p>
<p>In the end <strong>liberal theology runs in contradiction to the Bible</strong>. You
can believe liberals or the Bible, but not both. Will you allow
liberalism to infest the church?</p>
<p><strong>Liberal theology represents open rebellion against God</strong>, but lacks
the guts to admit it.</p>
<h3>Be Careful!</h3>
<p>It’s important when speaking in strong words about theology to not make
the leap it means <em>anything</em> about liberals personally.</p>
<p>They could be the nicest people you want living next door, axe
murderers, mother Teresa, or indwelt by Satan himself.</p>
<p>I know <em>nothing</em> about the Bishop’s personal character, however, he has
written considerably about his <em>theology</em>, and we <em>can</em> (and should) be
Bereans and search the scriptures to see if those things be so (Acts
17:11).</p>
<p>In this case liberal theology <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/09/the-danger-of-drifting.html">drifts away</a>
from Christianity, ending in a feel-good religion devoid of any
Christian substance.</p>
<p>Since the ideas presented contradict the Bible, you <em>must</em> make a choice
— <strong>is progressive theology represented by Spong correct, or is the
Bible correct?</strong> <em>They can’t both be right</em>.</p>
<h2>Rejecting the Foundations of Christianity</h2>
<p>Consider more from Bishop Spong, as recorded by the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070203143306/http://www.dioceseofnewark.org/jsspong/reform.html">diocese of Newark</a>;
you’ll quickly notice what Spong proposes bears resemblance to
Christianity in name only.</p>
<ol>
<li>Theism, as a way of defining God, is dead. So most theological
God-talk is today meaningless. A new way to speak of God must be found.</li>
<li>Since God can no longer be conceived in theistic terms, it becomes
nonsensical to seek to understand Jesus as the incarnation of the
theistic deity. So the Christology of the ages is bankrupt.</li>
<li>The biblical story of the perfect and finished creation from which
human beings fell into sin is pre-Darwinian mythology and
post-Darwinian nonsense.</li>
<li>The virgin birth, understood as literal biology, makes Christ’s
divinity, as traditionally understood, impossible.</li>
<li>The miracle stories of the New Testament can no longer be
interpreted in a post-Newtonian world as supernatural events
performed by an incarnate deity.</li>
<li>The view of the cross as the sacrifice for the sins of the world is
a barbarian idea based on primitive concepts of God and must be dismissed.</li>
<li>Resurrection is an action of God. Jesus was raised into the meaning
of God. It therefore cannot be a physical resuscitation occurring
inside human history.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once again, I have no idea what “raised into the meaning of God” could
possibly mean. As Spong denies a physical resurrection, I can only guess
he offers a modern retread of first century Gnosticism.</p>
<p>Let’s look at what his ideas really mean; Spong’s progressive
“Christianity”:</p>
<ul>
<li>Denies the deity of Christ. (#2)</li>
<li>Denies the virgin birth. (#4)</li>
<li>Denies the creation. (#3)</li>
<li>Denies the inerrancy of the Bible. (#2, #3, #4)</li>
<li>Denies the atonement of the cross. (#6, #7)</li>
<li>Denies the physical resurrection. (#7)</li>
</ul>
<p>Liberals use the same terms as traditional Christians, but it’s obvious
if you talked to Bishop Spong, you and he would <em>not</em> be speaking about
the same thing, <em>even while using the same words</em>.</p>
<p>That’s why the poison of liberal theology is so dangerous.</p>
<h2>A Liberal Pizza</h2>
<p>When talking with a liberal, <em>get them to define their terms</em>, and
you’ll discover Jesus, sin, salvation, heaven, hell, resurrection, and
more do <em>not</em> mean to the liberal what you understand them to be.</p>
<p><strong>Liberal theology re-defines words</strong> and can sound completely truthful,
all while speaking from the pit of hell, simply because liberal theology
does <em>not</em> use language the way everyone else does.</p>
<p>If I say let’s meet at the restaurant for pizza, you know what I mean
because we all use <em>restaurant</em> and <em>pizza</em> the same way.</p>
<p>But what if I subtly re-defined pizza to sandwich? You would be
confused.</p>
<p>When I said pizza, I didn’t mean <em>literal</em> pizza, but the <em>meaning</em> of
pizza. See, your sandwich has tomatoes, bread, cheese, and meat — just
like pizza. Your sandwich <em>contains</em> pizza, but it isn’t <em>all</em> pizza.</p>
<p>Exactly as liberals say the Bible <em>contains</em> the Word of God, but isn’t
<em>all</em> the Word of God (and they’ll tell you which is which, because, you
know, they’re scholars, and you’re not).</p>
<p>In reality, a sandwich could be 95% the same as pizza — <em>but you don’t
get to call it pizza because it’s mostly pizza</em>, or pizza-like, and you
don’t need to be a food scholar to know what they’re serving isn’t
pizza.</p>
<p>Why must you be so narrow on your idea of pizza?</p>
<p><strong>Liberal theology is pizza re-defined to sandwich</strong>. Close doesn’t cut
it — if your life depends on it (and it does), you’re dead using liberal
pizza.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whenever I hear people make statements I very much like to know what
they mean by the words because <strong>if they can’t define the words in
context they don’t mean anything</strong>. (Walter Martin — “The Cult of
Liberalism” lecture, emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Wheat and the Tares</h2>
<p>Paul warned people would not listen to sound doctrine, but whoever told
them what they wanted to hear.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but
after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having
itching ears; And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and
shall be turned unto fables. (2 Timothy 4:3–4)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Liberal theology tells people what they want to hear, replacing God’s
true Word with mythology. Sure, you can ignore parts of the Bible.
Paul’s rules for leaders? That was just cultural for his time.
Immorality? Nope, we must “modernize” those passages.</p>
<p>Many people chase after teachers telling them what they want to hear,
instead of searching for the truth. Yet some prefer <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/09/matrix-guide-christianity.html">living in Fantasyland</a>
over truth.</p>
<h2>Baptism of Boldness</h2>
<p>One of my favorite teachers remains Walter Martin — a guy who said it
like it is. As Walter Martin would say, we need a boldness to combat the
infestation of liberal theology which denies the Bible and declares God
a liar.</p>
<p>Will you make a stand for Biblical truth, or swallow the poison of
liberal theology?</p>
<iframe class="youtube-video" width="320" height="180" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pCGhvR-_q1I" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<p>You must be polite, yet firm, and challenge liberal theology as it oozes
and takes over churches like “The Blob.” Your action plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Force liberals to define terms</li>
<li>Demand agreement with the Bible</li>
<li>Be courteous</li>
<li>Reject double talk</li>
</ul>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
