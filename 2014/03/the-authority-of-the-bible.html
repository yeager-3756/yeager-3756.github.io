  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>One of the most popular articles I’ve written is on the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2008/12/deutero-isaiah-hypothesis.html">deutero-Isaiah hypothesis</a>
— the rather silly idea Isaiah didn’t actually write the book with his
name on it.</p>
<p>John quotes from both halves of Isaiah, and <em>attributes them to Isaiah</em>.
So who wrote Isaiah? Isaiah did.</p>
<p>Some people don’t like God’s Word, and express their God-denial in
not-so-nice terms.</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.dyeager.org/2008/12/deutero-isaiah-hypothesis.html#comment-410247913">
<p>…it is patently obvious to me that you are no student of the text at all. In fact, it is more apparent that you’ve performed no scholarship at all. In fact, you are merely poorly echoing on bits and pieces of feeble literature on divine inspiration and divine authorship. … You could have at least honored the school of higher criticism with a dignified, scholarly, and well-<span class="sic">reasonsed</span> honest approach. But you didn’t do that either. Sheesh! I’d be embarrassed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I’ve said before, if someone came to me with the theory the moon is
made of cheese, should I (we) spend time honoring their theory with a
dignified, scholarly, well-reasoned rebuttal of moon-cheese?</p>
<p>Hardly (in reality, moon-cheese proponents have a better argument
than deutero-Isaiah fans).</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.dyeager.org/2008/12/deutero-isaiah-hypothesis.html#comment-1083117352">
<p>With all due respect, your argument is total garbage. It’s premises are naive and its conclusions are weak. Many of the theologians who believe in the Deutero-Isaiah theory are confessing Christians who espouse belief in the theory because almost all of the evidence that we have ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of these negative comments don’t contribute much, and contain
errors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Argument from majority — “everyone believes it”</li>
<li>Personal attacks — “you’re stupid”</li>
<li>Argument from authority — “smart people believe it”</li>
</ul>
<p>The last one is funny. For you (ahem) youth-challenged people, remember
this Camel ad?</p>
<iframe class="youtube-video" width="320" height="180" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cKMn-_aQoPk" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<p>The tag line: <strong>more doctors smoke Camels, than any other cigarette</strong>.
Surely you take the word of a doctor, don’t you?</p>
<p>One person buried in the quagmire who actually did something beside make
snarky comments brought up a valid point which is worth addressing (as
opposed to moon-cheese).</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.dyeager.org/2008/12/deutero-isaiah-hypothesis.html#comment-410247912">
<p>Isaiah is proven to be the sole author of the book by John saying so? Using the Bible to prove the Bible is a brazen exercise in circular reasoning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That displays a common misunderstanding of the Bible. What is that
major, yet simple, error?</p>
<p><strong>The Bible isn’t one book</strong> — it’s 66 books written by dozens of
authors over thousands of years.</p>
<p>Nobody would argue otherwise … and yet … they do.</p>
<p>The Bible compiles many authors writings over thousands of years. It
speaks with a single voice, but most definitely is not a single book.</p>
<p>When John speaks of Isaiah, it’s the same as Lincoln speaking of
Washington.</p>
<p>What they subtly miss when stating the Bible is one book — it’s an
admission a single theme runs through it, almost as if a silent spirit
guided these guys while writing.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Trying to claim the Bible as one book shows two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Liberals don’t understand the Bible. Perhaps they should study a bit of history.</li>
<li>Liberals admit a singular theme exists — as if the writings were guided by the Holy Spirit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t get caught up in their mistakes. The Bible speaks with one voice,
but it is <em>not</em> one book.</p>
<p>For that reason, when John mentions Isaiah as the author, <strong>it’s not
circular reasoning, it’s credible testimony and evidence.</strong></p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
