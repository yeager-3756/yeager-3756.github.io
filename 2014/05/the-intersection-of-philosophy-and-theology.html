  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>The <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2014/04/logic-101-introduction.html">introduction to logic</a>
noted logic’s basic rule: the law of non-contradiction — something can’t
be true and false at the same time. In spite of how obvious that is,
it’s surprising how often someone argues exactly that. In this case, the
important lesson is not <em>how</em> non-contradiction was violated, but <em>why</em>
— something you <em>must</em> avoid.</p>
<p>Current events brought the death-penalty discussion back, as people on
both sides endlessly debate the issue. More interesting is the <em>logic</em>
behind those reasons, rather than the pro and con themselves.</p>
<h2>Arguing Truth and False at the Same Time</h2>
<p>A blog post from Sojourners (Jim Wallis’ organization) argues Christians
should not support capital punishment.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://sojo.net/blogs/2014/05/04/capital-punishment-don%E2%80%99t-start-old-testament">
<p>Yet, I think it is problematic for Christians to root their support of capital punishment in the Jewish Scriptures.</p>
<p>Such thinking requires a bit of arbitrary Biblical picking and choosing. Sure, the Old Testament prescribes death for anyone who commits pre-meditated murder. …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, they’re against capital punishment. They’re free to put forth
their reasons for doing so, and this one is simple: some capital
punishment arguments come from the Old Testament, and the author says we
shouldn’t follow the Old Testament.</p>
<p>Christians shouldn’t use the Old Testament to support government roles.
Got it.</p>
<p>That’s his view, and it’s not interesting to debate if he’s right or
wrong, for that’s not really the problem — his logic behind the reason
is.</p>
<p>But, what does Jim Wallis say? From an article titled “Caring for the
poor is government’s Biblical role” he cites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amos</li>
<li>Jeremiah and Josiah</li>
<li>Psalm 72</li>
<li>Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy</li>
<li>Isaiah</li>
</ul>
<p>He concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Governments should provide a check on powerful people, institutions,
and interests in the society that, if left unchecked, might run over
their fellow citizens, the economy, and certainly the poor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But wait, we’ve just been told <em>not</em> to use the Old Testament to justify
political processes.</p>
<p>Gotcha!</p>
<p>The law of non-contradiction. Sojourners argues at different times we
<em>should</em>, and should <em>not</em> use the Old Testament, or “~A ⇒ A.” They
both can’t be true.</p>
<h2>Philosophy and Theology</h2>
<p>What’s the problem? Violating the most basic of logical laws is
glaringly obvious. The vital lesson to learn is <em>why</em> these errors came
up.</p>
<p>Anyone reading even a bit of Sojourners and Jim Wallis quickly discovers
they’re a far-left political organization.</p>
<p>That’s fine, it’s their choice. The problem occurs when poor logic
creates theological problems. For example, government should do more for
the poor, and increase taxes on the rich to pay for it. The Old
Testament also exampled a flat-tax with everyone paying, but that’s not
an idea I’ve ever seen Sojourners promote.</p>
<p>They justify this position using the Old Testament and the nation of
Israel, and many of the previously noted Old Testament passages.</p>
<p>But when it comes to capital punishment? Then the example of Israel gets
tossed out, and we’re told not to use the Old Testament.</p>
<p>Why the difference?</p>
<h2>The Lesson</h2>
<p>Radical far-left proponents try to mold the Bible to political agendas,
instead of forming views <em>from</em> the Bible. The process they use is 100%
backward. Consider standard leftist ideology:</p>
<ol>
<li>Anti death-penalty</li>
<li>Pro-abortion</li>
<li>Increase taxes on the “rich”</li>
<li>Increased government social programs.</li>
</ol>
<p>To justify #3 and #4, Sojourners uses the Old Testament — A HA! Look
at Israel, they did these things, therefore we must as well.</p>
<p>But when capital punishment is brought up? Then we not only ignore
Israel and the Old Testament, it’s stated we should <em>not</em> use the Old
Testament.</p>
<p>Arguing something is both true and false, violating the law of
non-contradiction.</p>
<p>How does this happen? Groups like Sojourners <em>begin</em> with radical
far-left ideology, and then <em>try to make the Bible fit it</em>.</p>
<p>In this case, the first question is should Christians use Israel as an
example for modern government? Sojourners argues both sides — depending
on if the issue in question matches radical far-left ideology.</p>
<p>That’s an error you don’t want to make. Don’t try and cram ideology to
the Bible; allow God’s Word to form your ideology.</p>
<p>If you don’t, you’ll end up arguing something is both true and false at
the same time, which violates basic logic, as well as common sense.</p>
<p>And you thought logic wasn’t important, didn’t you?</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
