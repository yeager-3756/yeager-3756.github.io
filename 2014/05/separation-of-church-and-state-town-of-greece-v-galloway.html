<p>The First Amendment returns to the spotlight as the prayer issue rears
up again. Is that acceptable expression protected by the First
Amendment? Or prohibited by the same amendment?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of
speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to
assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regarding religion and government, two ideas are clear:</p>
<ol>
<li>Congress shall make no law establishing religion (i.e. national
church).</li>
<li>Nor prohibit the free exercise of religion.</li>
</ol>
<p>Tension exists between those two ideas. Can government both prevent
establishment of national religion while protecting God-given right to
free expression?</p>
<p>In the recent case concerning prayer before meetings in <em>Town of Greece
v. Galloway</em>, <abbr title="Supreme Court of the United States">SCOTUS</abbr> wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since 1999, the monthly town board meetings in Greece, New York, have
opened with a roll call, a recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, and
a prayer … Respondents, citizens who attend meetings to speak on local
issues, filed suit, alleging that the town violated the First
Amendment’s Establishment Clause … The District Court upheld the
prayer practice on summary judgment, finding no impermissible
preference for Christianity … The Second Circuit reversed …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SCOTUS reversed the reversal of the Second Circuit, permitting the
prayers. Naturally, some people are upset; a few lawyers who
participated in the case complained:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.religionnews.com/2014/05/06/commentary-town-prayers-what-does-supreme-court-mean-by-coercion/">
<p>The court’s decision, though, invites continued litigation: Nondiscrimination, coercion, and the question of mandatory attendance and penalties will continue to cause disputes …</p>
<p>There were alternatives to this troubling opinion: The court might have taken a strong position and declared that there should be no “official” legislative chaplains and no official governmental prayer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first paragraph displays a stunning misunderstanding of SCOTUS
decisions, by complaining the decision leads to further lawsuits. Yes,
it probably will, <em>but that’s the way SCOTUS decisions usually work</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Did the ruling on abortion eliminate further lawsuits?</li>
<li>When SCOTUS held the second amendment clearly states an individual
right to bear arms, did lawsuits over the issue stop?</li>
</ul>
<p>No, to both questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>On abortion, what constituents an “undue burden”?</li>
<li>On arms, what are permitted? Can government restrict who may carry what?</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously SCOTUS didn’t define those issues, and when parties can’t
agree, lawsuits begin.</p>
<p>That’s the way SCOTUS decisions usually work. That may not be a good
thing, but you can’t logically argue against this decision unless you
also argue the court was wrong to permit abortion.</p>
<p>The second complaint—that the court didn’t declare official chaplains
can’t exist—equally exhibits stunning ignorance of history and common
sense. But then, lawyers concern themselves with <em>law</em>, not common
sense.</p>
<p>Step back in Mr. Peabody’s wayback machine. Back to the times of the
Founders, Jefferson, and Madison.</p>
<p>Jefferson and Madison attended church services <em>in the House of
Representatives</em>; using Capital buildings for church services <a href="http://www.wallbuilders.com/libissuesarticles.asp?id=90">continued until after the Civil War</a>.</p>
<p>Many think Jefferson anti-religious, citing the (in)famous “wall of
separation” phrase. But as the Library of Congress notes, Jefferson
didn’t mean religious displays were impermissible, as his actions
clearly don’t back up what proponents of the wall think it means.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel06-2.html" title="Library of Congress">
<p>Within a year of his inauguration, Jefferson began attending church services in the House of Representatives. Madison followed Jefferson’s example … Worship services in the House—a practice that continued until after the Civil War—were acceptable to Jefferson …</p>
<p>Jefferson’s actions may seem surprising because his attitude toward the relation between religion and government is usually thought to have been embodied in his recommendation that there exist “a wall of separation between church and state.” In that statement, Jefferson was apparently declaring his opposition, as Madison had done in introducing the Bill of Rights, to a “national” religion. In attending church services on public property, Jefferson and Madison consciously and deliberately were offering symbolic support to religion as a prop for republican government.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously, neither Madison nor Jefferson had a problem with (gasp!)
using government buildings for religious purposes.</p>
<p>Later, the House itself resolved sessions to be opened with prayer, see
the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=fKkFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA354">Journal: 1st-13th Congress. Repr. 14th Congress, 1st Session - 50th Congress, 2nd
Session</a>, page 354</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whereas, the people of these United States, from their earliest
history to the present time, have been led by the hand of a kind
Providence and are indebted for the countless blessings of the past
and present, and dependent for continued prosperity in the future upon
Almighty God; and whereas the great vital and conservative element in
our system is the belief of our people in the pure doctrines and
divine truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ, it eminently becomes the
representatives of a people so highly favored, to acknowledge, in the
most public manner, their reverence for God: Therefore, Resolved,
first, That the daily sessions of this body be opened with prayer.
Resolved, second, and that the ministers of the Gospel in this city
are hereby requested to attend and alternately perform this solemn duty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Be honest — after all the anti-religious hysteria involving church and
state, would you believe such a resolution could exist?</p>
<p>The debate over <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/united-states-christian-nation.html">a Christian nation</a>
is settled — it’s a matter of record.</p>
<p>People may want to change the future of the country, but the past
remains stubbornly clear.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… many other matters which might be noticed, add a volume of
unofficial declarations to the mass of organic utterances that this is
a Christian nation. (SCOTUS in CHURCH OF THE HOLY TRINITY V. UNITED
STATES, 143 US 457, 1892)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/09/atheists-are-funny-especially-when-theyre-serious.html">Militant atheists</a>
attempt to re-write history, but only look foolish in the process.</p>
<p>Lawyers and common sense don’t always go together, but consider the text
of the First amendment and ask yourself if opening a meeting with prayer
<em>makes a law establishing a national religion</em>.</p>
<p>It clearly doesn’t, thus is <em>not</em> against the First Amendment.</p>
<p>For those arguing otherwise, please cite the bill and law number
supposedly created. If they can’t, it’s not a law, thus acceptable by a
common sense plain reading of the Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>Opening government meetings with prayer has been a foundation of the
United States. People may not like it, but history shows it, and the
Founders by their actions clearly agreed.</p>
<p>SCOTUS only upheld what has occurred in this country since its founding,
agreeing with the Founders actions.</p>
<p>To do otherwise would be judicial activism.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
