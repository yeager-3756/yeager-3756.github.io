  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Recent three-year and five-year reports from a NASA program (WMAP)
indicate the universe is 13.7 billion years old. Many Christians dismiss
those findings, claiming a “young earth” of about 6,000 years. Who
is right?</p>
<p>Some try to reconcile both views using theistic evolution — the idea God
created the universe, and then let it go it’s own way. These people
point to Genesis 1 and note the word for “day” could really mean “age”,
and thus billions of years could be indicated in Genesis 1.</p>
<p>But they have two problems with that view. First, the garden of Eden was
perfect — no entropy, decay or death — whether billions of years went by
or only a few days would make no difference. No decay, no aging, and no
way to tell how long Adam and Eve were in the garden.</p>
<p>But the bigger problem with the “days-as-ages” view isn’t found in
Genesis, but Exodus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work. But the seventh day is
the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work,
thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy
maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within
thy gates:</p>
<p>For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that
in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the
sabbath day, and hallowed it. (Exodus 20:9-11 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In those verses comparing the Sabbath with the creation the context is
clearly six 24-hour periods — creation in 6 days as we know them. You
can’t get out of this problem by the days-as-age claim, nor the gap
theory (which holds an indeterminate gap exists between Genesis 1:1 and
1:2, which also could have been billions of years).</p>
<p>No, the real solution to this problem is three-fold. First, what is
time? You may think of time as absolute, but it’s not. Einstein said
time varies for various reasons (relativity). So 15 billion years in one
frame can easily be just a few days in another. Time is not absolute.</p>
<p>Second, any attempt at dating anything for billions of years must make
some assumptions — that conditions can be more or less known over those
vast periods. Science must assume some things or it won’t get very far,
but to assume we know conditions billions of years ago with certainty
is absurd.</p>
<p>Finally, new studies are questioning if the speed of light has actually
been constant. This is quite controversial right now, but if it turns
out light has been slowing down, all of physics will be in chaos. Just
think, how many equations does “c” pop up in?</p>
<p>For the Christian, it isn’t really profitable to argue with the
evolutionist over the issue. Just use 15 billion years and be done with
it. We’ve written many articles discussing problems with
evolution which are much more interesting to
discuss. For starters, try these, any one of which turns out to be false
(and all have no proof, although transitional forms are debatable) dooms
the dogma of evolution to the scrapheap of history.</p>
<ul>
<li>Matter can come from nothing.</li>
<li>Non-living material can become alive.</li>
<li>Explosions produce order.</li>
<li>Species changing into another.</li>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
