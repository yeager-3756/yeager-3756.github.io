  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>The Bible translation debate rages on — which is best? Many argue the
“modern” translations are easier to read and we should stop using the
KJV and use one of the many newer translations; unfortunately ignoring
the textual basis and focusing only on easy-to-read is a grave error.</p>
<p>By that logic, use the NWT (New World Translation).</p>
<p>Obviously, translational differences <em>are</em> important. If they’re not,
just make up your own Bible and don’t worry about it — you won’t need
Jesus, sin, hell, sanctification, justification or forgiveness either.</p>
<p>We’ll refrain from discussion about the (should be) obvious error of
splitting churches over Bible translation, and we’ll leave it at that
(which we discussed extensively in our previous article on <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/01/which-bible-translation-best.html">Bible Translation</a>).
However, it also should be obvious insuring what you read is actually
what the Bible writers intended is critical.</p>
<p>When considering Bible translation, many issues arise but for simplicity
we’ll stick to two.</p>
<ol>
<li>What you’re translating from. Two lines of Greek texts exist
with differences.</li>
<li>How you translate what you’ve got.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most people focus on #2 — the easy-to-read argument, but completely
ignore #1 (Much discussion of #2 is available in our previously
mentioned article — we’ll focus on textual differences here).</p>
<p>While the textual debate continues, this discussion didn’t even exist
until the late 1800’s when Westcott and Hort edited the received text
and came up with their version — changing the Greek in thousands of
places. Why they did this, and their background is critical to
understanding the Bible translation debate.</p>
<p>The church used accepted texts for centuries, while the “critical” text
for the last 100 or so. Westcott/Hort relied heavily on Alexandrian
manuscripts — if Alexandria sounds familiar, it should — it was the
center of Gnostic heresy. Consider the words of
Westcott/Hort themselves:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the book which has most engaged me is Darwin. Whatever may be
thought of it, it is a book that one is proud to be contemporary with. I
must work out and examine the argument more in detail, but at present my
feeling is strong that the theory is unanswerable.
(<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Rxc3AAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover">Life of Hort Vol I</a> page 416)</p>
<p>… I am inclined to think that no such state as “Eden” (I mean the
popular notion) ever existed, and that Adam’s fall in no degree differed
from the fall of each of his descendants … (<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Rxc3AAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover">Life of Hort Vol I</a> page 78)</p>
<p>No one now, I suppose, holds that the first three chapters of
Genesis, for example, give a literal history-I could never understand how any
one reading them with open eyes could think they did …
(<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=CwMW115WoGEC&amp;printsec=frontcover">Life of Westcott Vol II</a> page 19)</p>
<p>Christians are themselves in a true sense “Christs”
(<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Tk9Wa8KE-JoC&amp;printsec=frontcover">The Epistles of St. John</a> page 73)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does that sound like orthodox Christian theology? The problem stems from
allowing their gnostic ideas to influence their Bible work. Everyone has
bias, the idea is to minimize it as much as possible. Even if their
views don’t matter or didn’t influence their work (doubtful), some of
the changes they made to the text don’t make sense, and some introduce
contradictions in the Bible.</p>
<p>Westcott/Hort delete Matthew 18:11, Acts 8:37 entirely (check your
translation and see if they’re there — many people are surprised to find
verses missing from their Bible), and edit other verses in ways that not
only don’t make sense, but contradict the Bible itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Matthew 25:13 NIV) Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the
day or the hour.</p>
<p>(Matthew 25:13 ESV) Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor
the hour.</p>
<p>(Matthew 25:13 NKJV) Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor
the hour in which the Son of Man is coming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Westcott/Hort delete “in which the Son of Man is coming”. In their
version, the verse just says you don’t know the day or the hour — so buy
a watch or sundial.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Ephesians 3:9 NIV) and to make plain to everyone the administration
of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who
created all things.</p>
<p>(Ephesians 3:9 ESV) and to bring to light for everyone what is the
plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things,</p>
<p>(Ephesians 3:9 NKJV) and to make all see what is the fellowship of the
mystery, which from the beginning of the ages has been hidden in God
who created all things through Jesus Christ;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Westcott/Hort remove the creation from Jesus, which contradicts Paul in
Colossians 1. In verse 17, Paul even tells you Jesus holds all the atoms
together — He’s the “strong nuclear force” as science calls it. Since
the Bible is inerrant, it must be Westcott/Hort making the mistakes,
not God.</p>
<p>There are of course many other changes, but these two examples
illustrate the editorial revisions Westcott/Hort made to the text. Those
arguing the insignificance of these edits argue from the “prego sauce”
view — the Bible is a jar of sauce and “it’s all in there” somewhere so
these individual edits don’t matter much. But should we allow editing of
the Word of God? Me thinks not.</p>
<p>The Textus Receptus (basis for KJV/NKJV) was the received text until
about 1900 when the critical text became popular, while the modern
translations generally don’t say Westcott/Hort, instead referring to
Nestle/Aland or UBS Greek text (which is basically Westcott/Hort). Each
modern translation then decides how much to follow Westcott/Hort (NASB
less, NIV and it appears ESV more, although experience with ESV
is limited).</p>
<p>No matter what translation you use, understand they <em>all</em> have problems.
The key is, do you know the foundation of the translation you use, and
do you understand the methodology and beliefs/bias of the people who
translated it? Picking a translation just because you like the way it
reads is foolish, and quite dangerous. You need to do some homework on
this subject and check it out for yourself — just because a new
easy-to-read translation comes out (and is “scholarly”) doesn’t mean
it’s good. How can you know you’re being deceived if you don’t do your
own homework?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; because thou hast
rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to
me; seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget
thy children. (Hosea 4:6 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you start making edits to the Word of God for language, gender or
other reasons, where does it stop? How much editing can you do to God’s
Word before it becomes unacceptable? After how many edits does the Bible
cease to be a Bible? Who gets to choose what edits should be made? And
why? Those are questions each Christian needs to answer for themselves;
unfortunately it requires work on your part.</p>
<p>The modern critical text began by Westcott/Hort is a corrupt line and
should be rejected by Christians. However, we are not espousing the
“KJV-Only” position — <em>any</em> soundly translated Bible from the Textus
Receptus is acceptable. As such, the NKJV is a choice for people who
want a Bible in an easier to read modern vocabulary. It also must be
noted recent translations have differing views on how closely they
follow Westcott/Hort — some follow it more closely than others.</p>
<p>Don’t believe anything anyone tells you — be a Berean (Acts 17:11) and
do your own research and don’t believe so-called scholars who come up
with absurd scholarly-sounding theories like the documentary hypothesis
and Deutero-Isaiah theory; theories having volumes of pseudo-scholarship
behind them and are quickly disproved by reading the Bible (without even
reading their reams of “scholarship”) — just because someone has a PhD
behind their name does not mean they’re right (though their hand-waving
arguments sway many). They can teach in seminary, have PhD’s and still
be quite wrong (or not even Christian).</p>
<p>Do your own homework. Please. Don’t use a translation just because you
like the way it reads. Be sure your Bible really is the Word of God.</p>

paraphrase, and more), covered in depth with footnotes, citations, and

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
