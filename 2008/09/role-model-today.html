<p>Chevrolet. NASCAR. No.3. The Intimidator. The Man in black. In the word
association game, any racing fan knows what comes next — Dale Earnhardt.
The finest stock car driver the world has ever seen was tragically
killed in a crash at Daytona speedway. In any sport, there is always one
person standing far above the rest. Joe Montana, Michael Jordon, Tiger
Woods, A.J. Foyt — and for stock cars, Dale Earnhardt. He dominated the
field — everyone else raced for second place.</p>
<p>And now, just as talk begun about Dale winning the Winston Cup
championship, he’s gone. The fans are shocked. Dale was the best — none
come close. Yet it’s hard to explain the vast amount of mourning for him
— people who most likely never met Dale Earnhardt lay flowers at the
track and hold candlelight vigils for him. Why?</p>
<p>We need role models.</p>
<p>In the Bible, Paul says imitate him as he imitates Christ (1 Corinthians
4:16, 11:1). But I can’t do that. First, I can’t imitate Jesus — he’s
perfect. So right away I’m in trouble. We can imitate Paul, you may say.
No I can’t. Here was a guy who (after Jesus revealed Himself)
immediately left everything he knew and adopted as his mission the
spread of the Gospel. I can’t imitate him either.</p>
<p>Perhaps none of these work for you. You can’t be like Jesus, Paul is too
lofty of a goal, and your parents were alcoholics who abandoned you as a
kid. What do you do? Who do you pattern your life after? One guy
mentioned in the Bible is exactly like us; the name may surprise you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Peter? It’s easy to relate to him — he always said the wrong thing
at the wrong time. But it’s not Peter.</li>
<li>How about James and John? When things didn’t go their way they
wanted to call down fire from heaven! (Luke 9) But it’s not them.</li>
<li>John became known as the apostle of love. Surely he is the role
model the Bible speaks about? Nope.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s Elijah. That’s right, Elijah. The Mount Carmel Elijah? You bet.
James specifically calls Elijah as a man who is like us.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed
earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by
the space of three years and six months. (James 5:17 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s take a quick review of the famous Mount Carmel episode.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him,
Art thou he that troubleth Israel? And he answered, I have not
troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father’s house, in that ye have
forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.
Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and
the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the
idols four hundred, which eat at Jezebel’s table. (1 Kings 18:17-19 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point in Israel’s history, Ahab was king. He was not one of
Israel’s better kings; he was down right wicked. His queen was Jezebel —
we’ll come back to her a little later. But for the Mount Carmel story,
suffice it to say a drought was in the land, and Ahab blamed not the
spiritual wickedness of himself and the nation, but Elijah. So Elijah
presents himself to the king, issuing a challenge between himself and
the 450 prophets of Baal. Who can have their god call down fire from
heaven? Two bulls are selected, and Elijah gives them first choice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And they took the bullock which was given them, and they prepared it,
and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O
Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they
leaped upon the altar which was made. And it came to pass at noon,
that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either
he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or perhaps he
sleepeth, and must be awaked. And they cried aloud, and cut themselves
after their manner with swords and lances, till the blood gushed out
upon them. And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they
prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice,
that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that
regarded. (1 Kings 18:26-29 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They strike out. Nothing. Nobody heard them. Gods made by man’s hand
can’t hear. Isaiah speaks of a craftsman who cuts down a tree and burns
part of it in the fire to cook with, but with the rest makes a god and
falls down to worship it and ask for deliverance. (Isaiah 44:14-17).
Does this make sense? In any event, the prophets of Baal accomplish
nothing. Their god does not answer, so it’s up to Elijah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening
sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of
Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art
God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all
these things at thy word. Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people
may know that thou art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their
heart back again. Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the
burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and
licked up the water that was in the trench. And when all the people
saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the
God; the LORD, he is the God. (1 Kings 18:36-39 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The LORD responds. Nothing of the alter is left — even the stones
are gone.</p>
<p>But back to our original issue — role models. That’s it, you say, I
could never be like Elijah. But this is NOT the story we’re looking for.
Stay with me for a minute; it’s not the Mount Carmel episode we’re
interested in, it’s what comes after this great victory that’s important
for us.</p>
<p>You can imagine Ahab and Jezebel were not too happy — not only does
their god not answer, but all their prophets are wiped out as well. In
the beginning of 1 Kings chapter 19, Jezebel threatens to kill Elijah.
So what does this mighty man of God do? He flees. (1 Kings 19:3)</p>
<p>Elijah was afraid. This I <em>can</em> relate to. Fear is an emotion most of us
have from time to time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of
love, and of a sound mind. (2 Timothy 1:7 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord does not want us to be afraid. He gives us the power and
ability to carry out anything he asks of us. Many of the men in the
Bible experienced fear; many required a special word of encouragement
from the Lord Himself — Isaiah in Isaiah 43:1-2, Paul in Acts 18:9-10,
and so on. I can relate to fear; I’m sure most people could as well. But
that wasn’t Elijah’s only problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and
sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he
might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for
I am not better than my fathers. (1 Kings 19:4 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now he’s depressed! Depression can frequently come after fear. After
fear does its part to paralyze us, depression sets in and we dwell on
our own resources, becoming depressed at our lack of ability to change
the situation. Again, many men of the Bible became depressed. Even Paul.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which
came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above
strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life: (2 Corinthians 1:8 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul got depressed — you can imagine why. He was shipwrecked, stoned,
left for dead, beaten, and more (As for myself, it would only take one
beating to be depressed, but then Paul had more character than I). But
Paul did get depressed just as Elijah did.</p>
<p>I can relate to depression. But Elijah doesn’t stop there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for
the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine
altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am
left; and they seek my life, to take it away. (1 Kings 19:10 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now he’s pouting and prideful, which leads to a question: Why did God
judge Sodom and Gomorrah? The answer isn’t what you think. Ezekiel tells
you in chapter 16 verse 49, where he presents a list of the problems of
Sodom — first on the list is pride. Pride is the root of all sin — it
caused the fall of satan originally (Isaiah 14:12-14).</p>
<p>So Elijah is fearful, depressed, desires to end his life, and prideful.
I can relate to each of these. So what you say? Remember the words of
James, Elijah is a man like us! And so we see he is. But wait, remember
the Mount Carmel episode? How many of us thought we can’t be like that?
Let’s go back and take another look at the words of James — if Elijah
was a man like us, we can turn that around to say we can be like Elijah.</p>
<p>Recall Elijah’s simple prayer “LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,
let it be known this day that You are God in Israel and I am Your
servant, and that I have done all these things at Your word. Hear me, O
LORD, hear me, that this people may know that You are the LORD God, and
that You have turned their hearts back to You again. (1 Kings 18:36-37
KJV)”. Simple prayer, yet look at the results — the Lord honored his
request. Many times we forget we don’t need to shout at God, and He
doesn’t give extra points for wordiness. However, passion, commitment
and a sincere heart do count. James says “The effectual fervent prayer
of a righteous man availeth much. (James 5:16 KJV)”.</p>
<p>Elijah prayed it wouldn’t rain, and it didn’t for 3 1/2 years. God is
not a genie who grants wishes, but I wonder what would happen if we had
faith when we prayed — would mountains move? Would we get the same
results as Elijah? Yet we <em>can</em> pray like Elijah, because we are
like him.</p>
<p>How abut boldness? Elijah was outnumbered 450 to one, yet it didn’t
bother him. We see in the Bible time and time again God doing much with
little (Gideon in Judges 7:2-9). Always remember God and you are a
majority anytime, anywhere. Don’t we want the boldness of Elijah? Can’t
we use that in our schools, and in our jobs? We are like him.</p>
<p>Finally, Elijah was raptured (2 Kings 2:6-11). Just as we will be.</p>
<p>See now, we <em>can</em> be like Elijah! Just as we can identify with his
faults and problems, we need to realize we can have our prayers
answered, have boldness in time of difficulty, and be raptured just as
he was. If Elijah was a man like us, never forget we can be like Elijah.</p>
<p>We need role models — let’s try Elijah for a change.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
