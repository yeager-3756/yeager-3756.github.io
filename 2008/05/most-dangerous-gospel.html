  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>We frequently hear of maintaining “unity” in the church — a worthy goal,
is it not? Yes, it’s true Christians shouldn’t quibble over petty
doctrinal differences (like dunking forward or backward during baptism),
yet a move is afoot which, while sounding thoroughly orthodox, proves
quite dangerous and not even Christian as it seeks to pervert
Christianity into something else, all while using the same vocabulary as
traditional Christianity.</p>
<p>This movement doesn’t try and hide their goal, drawing away many
ungrounded in the foundational doctrines of Christianity — or who desire
to appear intellectual and fit in with the crowd.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The minister at Toronto’s West Hill United Church, Rev. Gretta Vosper,
does not teach her congregation to recite the Apostle’s Creed. She
does not believe that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit or born
of a virgin. She does not believe that Jesus rose again from the dead
or ascended into heaven… or most of the basic tenets of Biblical
Christianity. In fact, when her congregation sings famous hymns, the
references to Christ and God are removed. Yet, Ms. Vosper calls
herself a “Christian” and runs a church in one of Canada’s largest
Protestant denominations.</p>
<p>Ms. Vosper believes that all that stuff about resurrection and
miracles and the forgiveness of sins is something the Christian Church
has to get past in order to make it in the 21st Century world. To her,
the essence of Christianity is about loving your neighbor. She
therefore follows some of the teachings of Christ — according to her
preferred interpretation of those teachings. The rest of his message,
about dying for our sins, rising again on the third day, and being one
with the Father, those must be things she just ignores.</p>
<p>On the other hand, famous evangelical theologian J.I. Packer has
recently cut his ties with the Anglican Church of Canada because a
significant portion of its liberal leadership has become heretical. He
is not alone in his concern. … <strong>A chasm has steadily grown between
those who hold conservative, Bible-based beliefs and those who affirm
more liberal, man-centered views</strong>. (<a href="http://www.khouse.org/enews_article/2008/1316/">Unity v. Truth in the Apostate Church</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ms. Vosper <em>may</em> be an extreme example (or maybe not), but churches
overflow with this cancer as so-called “Christians” abandon Christianity
for a mix of political correctness, new-age philosophy, and a
deep-rooted desire to meld with the world and its philosophical,
educational and political views. This heretical apostasy (a falling away
from Biblical Christianity) Paul warned against would come before the
return of Jesus (which the heretics deny anyway).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let no man deceive you by any means; for that day shall not come,
except there come the falling away first, and that man of sin be
revealed, the son of perdition; Who opposeth and exalteth himself
above all that is called God, or that is worshiped; so that he as God
sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God. (2
Thessalonians 2:3-4 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus warned about dead churches in his letters to the seven churches in
Revelation. To the church at Sardis (of which nothing good was said)
Jesus said they had a name (“Denomination”), but were dead. These groups
throwing traditional doctrine off the cliff are exactly the dead church
Jesus warned about — groups claiming to be religious, but having no
substance. Paul as well warned about those departing from Biblical
teaching which he taught the Galatians:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto
you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. As
we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel
unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed. For do I now
seek the favor of men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I
yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ. (Galatians 1:8-10 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those desiring to fit in with the ever-changing modern political and
social views (whatever is current), we just say welcome to the end-times
church — perhaps your church won’t need a new pastor after the rapture.
That’s harsh, you say. Well, it’s not <em>our</em> warning, it’s Jesus’ … and
Peter’s … and Paul’s. Should we heed their warnings, or sit idly by as
the church disintegrates before us?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Ms. Vosper is not alone in her views and rejection of
Christian doctrine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A number of leading theologians in Britain — where the decline in
adherents is more dramatic than in Canada — are on the same path,
people like Richard Holloway, former bishop of Edinburgh and primate
of the Scottish Episcopal (Anglican) Church, who has likened the
Christian church to a self-service cafeteria stacked with messy trays
of leftover food urgently in need of being thrown out.</p>
<p>Like Bishop Holloway, Ms. Vosper does not want to dress up the
theological detritus — her words — of the past two millennia with new
language in the hope of making it more palatable. She wants to get rid
of it, and build on its ashes a new spiritual movement that will have
relevance in a tight-knit global world under threat of human
destruction. (<a href="http://www.prophecynewswatch.com/March27/2751.html">Prophecy News Watch</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if an angel reveals something other than what Paul preached, you
must ignore them and their teaching. If we should ignore angels
deviating from orthodox Christianity, how much more the deviant wisdom
of man? These people are not Christian — they’re so deceived they simply
can’t understand what the apostle Paul warned about. Since they’re
teaching something different from what Paul did … well, draw your
own conclusions.</p>
<p>You’ll meet people who sound completely orthodox, yet deny foundational
doctrines of Christianity — even as they attend your fellowship and call
themselves “Christians”. Some of these have even infiltrated the
conservative churches promoting views not held by the vast majority of
Christians; a telltale sign can be when they say Christianity needs to
change to fit with modern society (or redefine common terms, or have a
compulsive need to “update” the Bible with modern language and
terminology. Sorry guys, God doesn’t change, and neither does His Word).</p>
<p>The parable of the tares in Matthew 13 (which Jesus Himself explains)
states satan will infiltrate the church with imposters — people who may
use the same language and might even be pastors or other leadership in
the church. Yet they are children of satan, not God.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the coming apostasy will affect all churches as the siren
song of liberal intellectualism sways many to their destruction. Those
are harsh words, you may say. Yes, they are. But remember the warning of
Paul about anyone teaching doctrine other than what he taught — they’re
not Christians and listening to them will lead you astray.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rev. Gretta Vosper is wrong about the future of Christianity. Biblical
Christianity that is full of the Spirit of God will never become
outdated. It might be scorned by the intellectuals who consider
themselves wise, and it might be rejected by those who seek the praise
of man over the praise of God. But, the Spirit of God is always at
work in the hearts of men, giving life to human spirits by the same
power that raised Jesus Christ from the dead. (<a href="http://www.khouse.org/enews_article/2008/1316/">Unity v. Truth in the Apostate Church</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ms. Vosper and her ilk are free to believe whatever they want, promote
it, and wrap it all up in secular humanism, intellectualism and
“scholarship”. But it’s <em>your</em> responsibility to realize what they’re
peddling is <em>not</em> Christianity (and it’s our job to be the watcher on
the wall and blow the trumpet in warning).</p>
<p>Here’s a clue — if someone promotes doctrines nobody in the church has
heard of since it’s inception, you might want to consider where it came
from. You have to choose God’s wisdom or man’s — it’s your choice. You
can choose the intellectual path of man or the wisdom of God — but know
and understand digressing from what Paul taught in the first century is
heresy — there’s no polite way to say it, they’re heretical teachings
attempting to lead people down the path of destruction.</p>
<p>Neutering the Bible, denying the virgin birth, seeking “modern”
translations of the Bible, denying sin and hell are all a part of this
new-age politically-correct heresy mixing in with the church. Do you
want Bible-based beliefs, or man’s liberal views? The church is
splitting on these terms, and it should surprise no one, as Paul
foretold it in the first century.</p>
<p>Some may say we’re being picky about defining words. After all, these
are pastors of mainline denominations! But language and definitions are
important; the premier expert on cults of our time is Walter Martin; he
had more experience about using language to distort and pervert (as well
as how cults use language to sound orthodox) than anyone else in our
time. Listen to his warning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m a rational empiricist and a devotee of inductive logic. Whenever I
hear people make statements I very much like to know what they mean by
the words because if they can’t define the words in context they don’t
mean anything. (Walter Martin)</p>
<p>The problem of semantics has always played an important part in human
affairs, for by its use or abuse, whichever the case may be, entire
churches, thrones, and even governments, for that matter, have been
erected, sustained, or overthrown. The late George Orwell’s stirring
novel 1984, in which he points out that the redefinition of common
political terms can lead to slavery when it is allowed to pass
unchallenged by a lethargic populace, is a classic illustration of the
dangers of perverted semantics. It should be of no particular surprise
to any student of world history that trick terminology is a powerful
propaganda weapon. (Walter Martin, “The Kingdom of the Cults” page 28-29)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So no, we’re not being picky — language definitions are important and
you can’t just change them to suit whatever bizarre belief you conjure
up and wish to rationalize; the cult of Liberalism is dangerous and
quite heretical. It’s common today for recently educated people to
borrow a tactic from the cults and switch definitions. After all,
they’ve been taught value relativism and the denial of absolutes — so
why should language be any different? They simply re-define any terms
they wish to suit their perverted ideas and claim they can’t be wrong no
matter what the evidence says.</p>
<p>That’s the reason it’s so hard to communicate with the cult of
Liberalism — you may be using the same words, but the cultist has deftly
redefined the terms to something else. It’s a common problem not only
with cultists, but anyone subjected to teachings of value relativism and
the denial of moral absolutes. Or as the book of judges says a time when
“everyone did what was right in their own eyes”.</p>
<p>If you don’t like Christianity, fine. Nobody forces you to be a
Christian. Start your own religion and redefine anything to whatever
intellectual, educational and philosophical ideas you want — but hands
off my Lord, my Bible, and the doctrines defining Christianity for
thousands of years. There are mountains to fight on, and others not to.
Attempting to replace Christianity with secular humanism and
intellectualism is one we’ll call out every time — it’s heresy, and to
say otherwise is to deny the Lord.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there
shall be false teachers among you, who secretly shall bring in
destructive heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and
bring upon themselves swift destruction. And many shall follow their
pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil
spoken of. (2 Peter 2:1-2 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can call yourself the President if you want but it doesn’t make it
so, just as these false teachers call themselves Christians, but aren’t.
It doesn’t matter if they have Phd’s, seminary or anything else —
they’re not Christian and their heresy kills like cancer.</p>
<p>Don’t fall for the lie.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
