  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>We’ve written about evolution before, yet continually encounter
misunderstanding and misrepresentations of the theory — frequently
hearing comments such as “overwhelming evidence exists” or the “evidence
is all around us” without any supporting proof given. Most likely, many
people writing letters lack understanding of the scientific method, and
if they do, never apply it to the “science” of evolution. Is evolution
scientific? We’ve seen lots of letters to the editor similar to
the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Phares Gilchrist’s May 19 letter claiming bias on the part of The
Register-Guard relative to information on evolution seems to fit the
current pattern: If information does not support your beliefs,
chastise the source rather than examine the information.</p>
<p>The fact is that intelligent design is not a valid scientific
explanation
for the evolution of life forms any more than is biblical creation.
Intelligent design is simply impossible to prove or disprove. The
amazing complexity and intricacy of life and its processes are, by
themselves, not evidence of a creator or intelligent design.</p>
<p>The underlying principles of evolution not only have explanatory
value but also predictive value. Predictive value means that you can
develop hypotheses that can be tested with objective information by
you and others. (<a href="http://www.registerguard.com/news/2005/05/28/ed.lettersop.0528.html">Intelligent design lacks merit</a> letter to editor, Register-Guard May 28, 2005)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where is this objective information? What is the scientific method, and
does evolution follow it? Basically, the scientific method involves
making observations, then predictions, and then experiments to prove or
disprove the hypothesis.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method">
<p>A scientific method or process is considered fundamental to the scientific
  investigation and acquisition of new knowledge based upon physical evidence.
  Scientists use observations, hypotheses and deductions to propose
  explanations for natural phenomena in the form of theories. Predictions
  from these theories are tested by experiment. If a prediction turns out to
  be correct, the theory survives. Any theory which is cogent enough to make
  predictions can then be tested reproducibly in this way. The method is
  commonly taken as the underlying logic of scientific practice. A scientific
  method is essentially an extremely cautious means of building a supportable,
  evidenced understanding of our natural&nbsp;world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The letter writer states the hypothesis of evolution can be tested with
objective information. Really? Evolution (like all science) is built
from the base by various other ideas. If that base is wrong, the rest of
the theory doesn’t matter. At the base of evolution are (at least) three
foundational principles.</p>
<ol>
<li>Matter comes from nothing.</li>
<li>Non-living material can spontaneously become alive.</li>
<li>Species can change from one to another.</li>
<li>Explosions produce order.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are valid scientific hypothesis — Darwin made a scientific
hypothesis which should be proved or disproved by experimental evidence.
According to the scientific method, we should have repeatable
experiments to prove such things are true. Where is it?</p>
<p>If you have no repeatable experiments for these ideas, they’re not
science. Interesting ideas perhaps, but not science. Debatable? Sure.
But not science. Evolution builds upon these ideas (and others) <em>a
priori</em> simply because the theory requires it. But where is the
evidence? Have any of these ever been observed? And since they don’t
obey scientific laws we accept in all other areas of science, why accept
them as the foundation of evolutionary theory? That’s unscientific.</p>
<p>So why do scientists abandon their own method? Perhaps because some
desire to explain away God they grasp for anything no matter how
ridiculous. They appear to be on the quest for scientific knowledge, all
along abandoning rational conclusions coming from that knowledge. To
claim to be on the quest for knowledge, while refusing to consider an
entire body of ideas is scientific fraud.</p>
<p>So evolution is unscientific (by definition). It may be interesting, but
not science. But this abandonment of certain conclusions you don’t like
affects other groups as well. So-called “free-thinkers” really aren’t.
Their own definition of freethinker is:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.ffrf.org/nontracts/freethinker.php">
<p>A person who forms opinions about religion in the basis of reason,
  independently of tradition, authority, or established belief.
  … To the freethinker, revelation and faith are&nbsp;invalid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, the freethinker really isn’t, because an entire group of thought
is off-limits. That isn’t so free, is it? It’s a common problem among
scientists and philosophers who place areas of ideas “off-limits” and
not consider them, all the while claiming to be independent and free
(The myth of “academic freedom” in higher education also stumbles into
this problem).</p>
<p>The problem is bias. Everyone has bias of some sort; true objectivity is
a myth. The goal must be to put aside preconceived ideas and (as
objectively as possible) consider the evidence on merits alone. Once a
scientist (or anyone else) considers facts through a preconceived
filter, the true quest for knowledge stops. The mistake becomes assuming
your hypothesis is true, and looking at all evidence in that light
(confirmation bias). When that occurs, it fails to be science.</p>
<p>Finally, two thoughts directed at the two extremes of the evolutionary
debate. First, many religious people make comments like “Darwin was
satan” or other nonsense. But Darwin’s religious views are irrelevant.
He made a hypothesis as science requires. The fact it lacks proof is the
issue, not Darwin’s religious status.</p>
<p>And for the evolutionist (I hope you’ve read this far), please avoid
sending me ad hominem attacks or red herring arguments about Bible
errors, the church or perhaps some evidence that “proves” evolution. If
you don’t have proof for matter coming from nothing, or non-living
material suddenly becoming alive (the first steps in the evolutionary
process), you need to deal with those issues first, on a scientific
basis. No reason exists to discuss other points of the theory when it’s
built on an unscientific foundation.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
