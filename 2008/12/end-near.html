<h4>When will Jesus return?</h4>
<p>At the turn of the new millennium many people predict the return of
Jesus Christ to the earth. Even gossip rags in the grocery store
proclaim in bold type “Jesus will return in 2000”. What should we make
of these claims? And more important than what we think, what does the
Bible say about it? Is the return of Jesus near? Can we know? Many
people point out that Christians for centuries have believed Jesus would
return in their lives — and all died. Does a Christian today really have
the truth when they say Jesus will return in their lifetimes? Isn’t that
presumptuous on our part?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beloved, I now write to you this second epistle (in both of which I
stir up your pure minds by way of reminder), that you may be mindful
of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the
commandment of us, the apostles of the Lord and Savior, knowing this
first: that scoffers will come in the last days, walking according to
their own lusts, and saying, “Where is the promise of His coming? For
since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from
the beginning of creation. (2 Peter 3:1-4 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first part of this issue is simple: just the fact that people are
doubting the return of Jesus is a sign to us it is near! But the real
issue for most Christians can be summed up in the following e-mail I
recently received regarding the return of Jesus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They were claiming that back in Jesus’ day too, how can we know He’s
coming in our time? That’s what we say for ourselves, it’s only OUR
estimations and calculations, maybe those folks back then had their
reasons too … how can we claim it [the soon return of Jesus]?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, let’s dismiss a common problem: Nobody knows exactly when Jesus
will return. Anyone who sets a date or time is displaying their lack of
knowledge about the Bible. The Bible clearly states no one knows the
exact day (Matthew 24:36, 25:13, Mark 13:32, etc). So if you’re
expecting dates and times from this article, don’t waste your time: none
will appear.</p>
<p>As already mentioned no one knows when Jesus will return. But some
people go to the opposite extreme and say since we don’t know, it
shouldn’t matter to us — we can do what we want, since His return is far
off. But this is wrong, and the Bible does have much to say about that
attitude. In Luke 19 during Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem (Palm Sunday),
He stopped and wept over the city. Why? Because He knew that these same
people, who today were crowning Him as the Messiah, would in a few days
be yelling “crucify Him — we have no king but Caesar”? No. He wept over
the city because “if you had known, even you, especially in this your
day, the things that make for your peace!” — Jesus expected them to know
when He would arrive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When it is evening you say, ’It will be fair weather, for the sky is
red’; and in the morning, ’It will be foul weather today, for the sky
is red and threatening.’ Hypocrites! You know how to discern the face
of the sky, but you cannot discern the signs of the times. (Matthew
16:2-3 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So let’s look at a few ideas in the Bible speaking about end times.
Along the way, we’ll learn a valuable lesson about how to approach
the Bible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then many false prophets will rise up and deceive many. And because
lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold. (Matthew
24:11-12 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What characterizes our society today? Deceit. The more digging you do,
the more you find out how you have been lied to — our society promotes
deceit (try buying a car). For those of you who doubt that statement,
just consider the farce of evolution. Evolution isn’t credible science.
Yet today our kids are brainwashed that we came from monkeys. “From the
goo to the zoo to you” as Doctor Mark Eastman says.</p>
<p>But notice the statement the love of many will grow cold — love is
agape. And in the Church today we see a lack of genuine love. We have
“user friendly” churches not speaking the truth for fear of offending
someone. If you see someone doing something that is harmful to them, and
will kill them (read that send them to eternal damnation), yet refuse to
say something, is that love? Yet the Church today is afraid to take a
stand against sin and for the Bible and Jesus, because that’s not a
popular message. The love of the Church is growing cold. As a result,
countless people are trusting in a counterfeit gospel that cannot save
them. Deceiving people such that they suffer eternal damnation as a
result (all in the name of church attendance) is not only a lack of
love, it’s a serious transgression some pastors will have to answer for
at the throne of God.</p>
<p>Let’s also look at what Paul has to say about signs of the end times in
his second letter to Timothy, chapter three.</p>
<p><em>“But know this, that in the last days perilous times will come”.</em> Paul
speaks about the last days before the return of Jesus, giving a list of
signs that will accompany the end days. The first is perilous times will
come. Can crime get much worse these days? As people today put bars on
their doors and windows, and are afraid to go out at night, we
definitely live in perilous times. But that’s just the domestic scene.
On the world scene we have the proliferation of nuclear and biological
weapons, unstable economies, and a steady erosion of personal integrity,
truth, and justice (and the American way). Perilous times indeed.</p>
<p><em>“For men will be lovers of themselves”.</em> Anyone who has been to the
grocery store knows this one. All the magazine rack speaks about is
yourself. Ignore everyone else and look out for number one. This is also
the idea behind advertising — after all, you deserve a break today.</p>
<p><em>“lovers of money”</em> Fox network launched a new show called the “Tower of
Greed”. Enough said.</p>
<p><em>“boasters, proud, blasphemers”</em> - We’re number one.</p>
<p><em>“disobedient to parents”</em> It’s interesting this is a sign of the end.</p>
<p><em>“unthankful, unholy, unloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without
self-control, brutal, despisers of good, traitors, headstrong, haughty,
lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, having a form of godliness
but denying its power.”</em></p>
<p>So in general our society is exactly what Paul said it would be in the
last days. Can it get worse? Probably. But let’s move on to specific
ideas presented in the Bible about the last days. One of the exciting
benefits about studying the end times is learning a valuable lesson
about the Bible — we must take it seriously. Some of the following
passages have mystified Christians in previous years, simply because
they didn’t understand it; they try and find analogies and other methods
by which to explain it. But by saying “what does it mean when it says
1/3 of the people die” we miss an important point: The Bible says what
it means and means what it says. Analogies and other figures of speech
are sometimes used, but problems are caused in Bible interpretation not
because we don’t understand what the Bible says, but because we DO
understand it, and just can’t explain it (or accept it). Take the Bible
seriously and you won’t have this problem.</p>
<p>Let’s start off with a fun one from Zechariah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And this shall be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the
people who fought against Jerusalem: Their flesh shall dissolve while
they stand on their feet, Their eyes shall dissolve in their sockets,
And their tongues shall dissolve in their mouths. (Zechariah 14:12)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like a neutron bomb, doesn’t it? This is recent technology — in
the past people would try and figure out what these verses meant — after
all, it’s hard to picture people’s flesh just dissolving while they
stand on their feet. But today we know it means exactly what it says.
While it’s true it could be something else <em>besides</em> a neutron bomb, we
have the ability to see this in its literal fulfillment. See how easy
this is if you take your Bible seriously? Let’s try another. Jesus
speaking in Matthew chapter 24 says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be saved; but for
the elect’s sake those days will be shortened. (Matthew 24:22 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was absurd with the swords, muskets, and cannon weaponry of ago.
Many didn’t believe this could be true until the 1940’s, when with the
invention of atomic weapons we could see how man could literally
exterminate everything on this planet.</p>
<p>The Bible also speaks of Israel being back in the land again (Isaiah
11:11-16, Ezekiel 34:11-16). This is old news. Since May 1948, Israel is
back in the land again — another time to take your Bible seriously. Many
were wondering what does it mean when it says Israel will be back in the
land? Simple. It means Israel will be back in the land again.</p>
<p>And it’s always fun to look at Revelation chapter 13.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to
receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that no
one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the
beast, or the number of his name. (Revelation 13:16-17 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We don’t want to deflect off the issue and start analyzing who the
antichrist is, but tracking the world’s economy wasn’t possible until
the computer age. How can you control the entire world’s buying and
selling? It takes quite a computer database to accomplish that.</p>
<p>So the question is, if we see we are in the last days, what is the next
event? The rapture of the church. This is another area in which to take
your Bible seriously — it means what it says and says what it means. But
let’s allow quantum physicist apostle Paul to explain to us the rapture:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the
kingdom of God; nor does corruption inherit incorruption. Behold, I
tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be
changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet.
For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible,
and we shall be changed. (1 Corinthians 15:50-52 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse is commonly misunderstood by people who claim a post or mid
tribulation rapture for the church. After all, Paul says “at the last
trumpet” — and we see seven trumpet judgements in the book of
Revelation, therefore, the rapture happens after those. But anyone who
has been to school knows what Paul means. When you go to school, a bell
rings to notify you when you need to be in class, and you have to be in
class before the last bell rings. But how many “last bells” are there?
Once for each class — every day. It doesn’t mean no bells sound ever
again, but that it’s the last call for the class — after that you are
tardy. That’s what Paul means here — it’s the last call for the church —
and you don’t want to miss this tardy bell!</p>
<p>But let’s dive into the physics of what Paul speaks of. Some people like
to question how fast the rapture occurs. Paul says “in the twinkling of
an eye” — and some people have timed how fast that occurs, and say the
rapture happens in a thousandth of a second or so. But the phrase “in
the twinkling of an eye” is really a modifier of Paul’s first statement
— “we shall all be changed in a moment” — and that statement tells us
exactly how fast the rapture occurs. In the Greek, the word for moment
is atomos or atom. Big deal. It is if you understand physics and the
nature of time. If you look in Strong’s concordance, he defines atom as
“indivisible (an ’atom’ of time): — moment” (Strongs definition G823).
The Greeks called atoms atoms because they felt it was the smallest
thing possible; you could not divide it. It turns out time also has a
smallest unit; beyond it you can’t get any smaller. You would think you
could take a second and cut it in half, then half again, etc infinitely.
But you can’t. When you get to a unit of time at 10<sup>-43</sup> seconds, you
can’t divide it anymore. This is called the Planck time. So when Paul
says we will be changed in an atom of time he means 10<sup>-43</sup> seconds!
That’s fast. To imagine how this happens, imagine a film, and instead of
16 frames per second, you have 10<sup>43</sup> frames per second. Now imagine you
can look at each frame individually. What you would see is in one frame
people, the next they are gone!</p>
<p>Now, if you have studied a little about quantum physics, the preceding
paragraph has great meaning for you. If you haven’t and want to (doesn’t
everyone?), a great place to start is with a book called <span
class="Underline">Alice in Quantumland</span>- it’s an easy way to
understand some of the concepts in physics without all the math getting
in the way. It’s really an easy reading book.</p>
<p>But if you’re totally lost in quantumland (the preceding explanation was
indeed brief — after all we don’t want to wander too far off) just
consider this about your Bible — why did Paul use such a word when
speaking of the rapture? It may not have meant much then, but today we
know exactly what he was saying. Either Paul was 2,000 years ahead of
Einstein, or he had some special tutoring! And of course, he did:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I make known to you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached
by me is not according to man. For I neither received it from man, nor
was I taught it, but it came through the revelation of Jesus Christ.
(Galatians 1:11-12 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But let’s return to our original question: How can we be sure we are
living in the time when Jesus will return? We can’t. <em>But that’s not the
real issue.</em> What? The issue is not whether we are right or not, for no
one knows when Jesus will return — we live in the times of the signs to
be sure, but cannot claim with definite proof the Lord will return in
our time. The issue is one of how we will live our life — do we live as
if we are <em>expecting</em> Jesus to return? This is the question. Allow Peter
to explain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which
the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will
melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it
will be burned up. <span class="Underline">Therefore, since all these
things will be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in
holy conduct and godliness, looking for and hastening the coming of
the day of God</span>, because of which the heavens will be dissolved,
being on fire, and the elements will melt with fervent heat?
Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a
new earth in which righteousness dwells. (2 Peter 3:10-13 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How should we live? Do you live as if Jesus could return at any time?
Are there some things you wouldn’t want to be doing when He returns? If
so, the solution is obvious. Are you using the talents and gifts He’s
given to you for His glory? Or are you a lover of self? Or money? Or
pleasure? We are stewards of what we have been given, and Paul reminds
us “it is required in stewards that one be found faithful (1 Corinthians
4:2)”. Are you faithful with what you have been given? If you believe
Jesus could return at any moment, does that change how you view your
service for the Lord? Consider the following teaching Jesus gave about
servants in their service:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the kingdom of heaven is like a man traveling to a far country,
who called his own servants and delivered his goods to them. <span
class="Underline">And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and
to another one, to each according to his own ability</span>; and
immediately he went on a journey. Then he who had received the five
talents went and traded with them, and made another five talents. And
likewise he who had received two gained two more also. But he who had
received one went and dug in the ground, and hid his lord’s money.
After a long time the lord of those servants came and settled accounts
with them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“So he who had received five talents came and brought five other
talents, saying, ’Lord, you delivered to me five talents; look, I have
gained five more talents besides them.’ His lord said to him, ’Well
done, good and faithful servant; you were faithful over a few things,
I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your
lord.’ He also who had received two talents came and said, ’Lord, you
delivered to me two talents; look, I have gained two more talents
besides them.’ His lord said to him, ’Well done, good and faithful
servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you
ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.’</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Then he who had received the one talent came and said, ’Lord, I knew
you to be a hard man, reaping where you have not sown, and gathering
where you have not scattered seed. And I was afraid, and went and hid
your talent in the ground. Look, there you have what is
yours.’(Matthew 25:14-25 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice the principle — each has been given talent according to his
ability. The master didn’t judge the man with five talents and say “why
did you not get ten, like the other servant?” Each was judged according
to his ability and gifts. But the warning is clear: don’t hide your
talents. But again, would you do this if you thought your master would
come at any time and ask for an account of what you have been given?
That’s why it’s important for us to live as if Jesus will return at any
moment. First of all, He could. But second (and most important for us),
<em>it changes the way we live our Christian life.</em> That’s the real reason
we should believe the return of Jesus is near.</p>
<p>But to those who still look upon me as a dreamer, I have this to say —
Yes, I believe the Lord’s return is near, and His return will occur in
my life. But I could be wrong. But if I am, add me to the apostles Paul,
John and Peter. Count me with the Chuck’s (Smith and Missler). Mark me
with McGee (J Vernon). Consider me with Courson (Jon). Mention me with
Martin (Walter). List me with Lenhard. If I’m wrong, I want to be
counted in that group of men.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even so, come, Lord Jesus! The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with
you all. Amen. (Revelation 22:20-21 NKJV)</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
