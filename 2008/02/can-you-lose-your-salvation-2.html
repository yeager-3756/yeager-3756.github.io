  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>One of our most popular articles concerns losing salvation — some say
you can once be saved, and they become unsaved, others say you can’t.
Yet that article still generates much of the email we receive.</p>
<p>One of the arguments against once saved, always saved we hear is “if
that’s true, it means I can live any way I want and still be saved”. Not
so fast.</p>
<p>Don’t interpret the permanence of salvation to mean you can live any way
you want and be saved. If people live in perpetual sin that’s a clue
they might not be saved, no matter what they say. For example, I can say
I’m the President all I want, and that doesn’t change the facts. Many
people may <em>think</em> they’re saved, but if they don’t have the fruit,
their proclamation is worthless.</p>
<p>Another way to look at it is if you <em>ever</em> have eternal life, but then
lose it, was it really eternal to begin with? Eternal life is by
definition irrevocable. To say otherwise means not only was it not
eternal, but God somewhere changed his mind, and that’s an area we don’t
want to go.</p>
<p>The major question isn’t losing salvation, but were you ever saved in
the first place? That’s a more troubling question, and one many don’t
want to deal with.</p>
<p>You did nothing to earn your salvation (it’s a gift from God), so
there’s nothing you can do to lose it. In short, I know <strong>I</strong> can’t lose
my salvation, because I know who I’ve trusted for it, and I did nothing
to earn or merit it. God won’t change his mind, and I can’t disappoint
Him as He already knows all the mistakes I’ll make until the day I die.</p>
<p>And He still choose me anyway.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
