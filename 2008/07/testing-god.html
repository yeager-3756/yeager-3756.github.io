  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Should a Christian refuse medical treatment and rely on faith and prayer
alone to heal? Consider the following news out of Oregon:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.registerguard.com/csp/cms/sites/dt.cms.support.viewStory.cls?cid=115861">
<p>PORTLAND — A legislative leader says Oregon lawmakers will take another look at state laws in the light of the death of a 16-year-old boy who died of a treatable urinary tract disorder while family and church members prayed over him.</p>
<p>Neil Beagley died Tuesday of complications from a urinary-tract blockage that a medical examiner said could have been treated with a catheter. He was at his grandmother’s home in Gladstone, surrounded by his family and dozens of other members of Oregon City’s Followers of Christ Church. The nondenominational congregation shuns medical treatment in favor of spiritual healing.</p>
<p>The case is complicated by a 1971 law that gave children 15 and older the right to seek medical care independent of their parents. <em>The law was intended, in part, to give girls access to birth-control information, contraceptives and abortions</em>. It was twice expanded to include access to treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, and to include mental health and substance abuse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How should a Christian handle those situations? Is it a lack of faith to
accept medical treatment?</p>
<h2>The Legal and Political Perspective</h2>
<div class="content-box-red">
<p>We are not doctors, and can not give medical advice. Each situation is
unique, and wise is the person who discusses options with doctors before
taking any action regarding treatment. Foolish is the person making
decisions without adequate and competent advice.</p>
</div>
<p>We’ve created quite a mess with all the abortion laws. If a 15 year old
can secretly get an abortion and terminate her baby, surely a 16 year
old can refuse medical treatment; the arguments for the 15 year old’s
abortion apply the same to the 16 year old refusing treatment — you
can’t be consistent and allow one and deny the other.</p>
<p>The groups promoting all-abortion, all the time put themselves in a
bizarre situation attempting to justify allowing a 15 year old to decide
on abortion by themselves, but not a 16 year old any other
medical decision.</p>
<p>As society loses its moral compass, expect more conflicting situations
like this (your daughter can’t get an aspirin in school without parental
notification, but terminating her baby is completely acceptable).</p>
<h2>The Christian Perspective</h2>
<p>But it’s the Christian perspective we need to understand (and is more
important than the political perspective anyway). Recall in Matthew as
Jesus faces three temptations from satan. First, to make bread (and
doubt God’s provision). Third, to appeal to shortcuts for God’s plan.</p>
<p>And in between those two, to ask God to <em>prove</em> what He said was so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then the devil took him into the holy city. He set him on the pinnacle
of the temple, and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw
yourself down, for it is written, ‘He will give his angels charge
concerning you.’ and, ‘On their hands they will bear you up, So that
you don’t dash your foot against a stone.’” Jesus said to him, “Again,
it is written, ‘<strong>You shall not test the Lord, your God</strong>.’” (Matthew 4:5-7 WEB)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What satan said was simple: if God will take care of you, why not jump
off a building and give Him the opportunity to <em>show</em> it? Surely God
will protect you, right? Don’t you have faith? But Jesus didn’t take the
bait, and responded don’t test God — it would be foolish to jump off a
building (if it’s foolish for Jesus Himself, should we not even more
head the warning?).</p>
<p>But what about faith? If you’re praying about an illness, why put trust
in doctors instead of God? Consider this — do you eat breakfast?
Presumably, you got out of bed, went to the kitchen, opened up the
cabinet and grabbed the box of Frosted Flakes. Was that a lack of faith?
After all, if God <em>really</em> wanted you to eat, He would have miraculously
materialized the bowl while you were in bed. Absurd? Of course — but
then why use similar logic with healthcare?</p>
<p>Do you lay in bed and just say “I have faith God will feed me”? We hope
not. You get a job, go to work, earn money, go to the store, purchase
food, and then prepare and finally (the tricky part), <em>eat</em> the food.
What a lack of faith! Don’t you trust God? (Such a person would be
labeled foolish, and rightly so)</p>
<p>Absurd, isn’t it? Then why use the same argument to reject medical care?
It’s just as absurd when applied to medicine as to food.</p>
<p>We’re not talking about rejection of some medical <em>options</em> — choice in
treatment options should <em>always</em> be discussed with doctors and informed
choices made tailored to <em>your</em> unique situation — each person must
decide for themselves how to best handle treatment, in consultation with
doctors, family and others.</p>
<p>God uses different ways to accomplish His goals. You’ll notice in the
Gospels Jesus didn’t have a pattern for healing, each differed from the
previous. Yes, you should pray and seek the Lord’s intervention, and
then do what you are able — doctors can be the instrument used to
accomplish healing; it’s not a lack of faith to go to a doctor.</p>
<p>Medical decisions are complicated and difficult. If you’re facing a
terminal illness, your decisions will necessarily be quite different
from an easily cured condition. Don’t make any broad assumptions about
complete reliance or complete rejection of medicine — each situation is
unique and should be treated as such, in consultation with doctors who
know both you and your medical history.</p>
<p>God uses different methods to accomplish his plan throughout the Bible,
how can you know if He won’t use a doctor as his vessel for healing? If
you’re hungry, you go to the kitchen; if you’re sick, consult a doctor —
it’s not a lack of faith to avail yourself of medicine.</p>
<p>Jesus didn’t ask God to prove Himself, why should we?</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
