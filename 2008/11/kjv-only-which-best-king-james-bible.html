<p>We’ve written on the Bible translation debate before (search the site
for more). If you’ve read the previous articles, you know we take a
moderate view — both the KJV-Only people are wrong, as well as those
defending the corrupt Alexandrian texts from which most modern versions
derive. A moderate approach proves correct as those claiming the
acceptability of any modern translation clearly haven’t done their
homework, while those claiming the inspiration and inerrancy of the KJV
have no proof.</p>
<p>We recently ran across an explanation highlighting the position of
<a href="http://av1611.com/forums/showthread.php?t=245">KJV-Onlyism in it’s various forms</a>, and it’s a good
summary of the various positions, both the moderate and extreme views.
It may surprise you to learn even among those proclaiming KJV-Only
considerable debate exists.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://av1611.com/forums/showthread.php?t=245">
<h2>CLASS ONE: KING JAMES BIBLE FAVOURED&nbsp;(PREFERRED)</h2>
<p>History: Because for many years the King James Bible was used, and due to tradition and conservative forces, that Bible has continued to have been used in certain movements and ministries, though not exclusively, and often modern versions might be used in conference, and there is a willingness to adopt modern King James Bible editions or&nbsp;versions. </p>
<ul><li>Inspiration: The Autographs are 100% infallible, inspired and&nbsp;perfect. </li>
<li>Preservation: Overall the Word of God is preserved through&nbsp;time. </li>
<li>The KJB text: The KJB text is at least 99%&nbsp;correct. </li>
<li>The text in English: Overall the text of the Word is probably in English&nbsp;versions. </li>
<li>The KJB translation: Very good, but there are occasional areas which can be&nbsp;improved. </li>
<li>The KJB language/style: Generally good, but the archaic language is a stumbling block to new believers, which requires or allows for updating the language or other good versions to bring out the meaning&nbsp;better. </li>
<li>The perfection of the KJB: The KJB is faithful and reliable, but not&nbsp;perfect. </li>
<li>Other versions: Some other versions are valid or&nbsp;acceptable. </li>
<li>Other languages: The Word of God should continue to be translated into other&nbsp;languages.</li>
</ul><p>The future of the KJB: The KJB will probably continue to be upheld by an extreme minority, but generally, with the changing language, new discoveries and progressive revelation of the Church, changes are&nbsp;inevitable. </p>
<p>Which edition of the KJB: Any current&nbsp;one. </p>
<h2>CLASS TWO: KING JAMES BIBLE DEFENDED (TR&nbsp;ONLY)</h2>
<p>History: Because for many years the King James Bible was used, and due to tradition and conservative forces, that Bible has continued to have been used in certain movements and ministries. The principles of modernism are deficient, which means that the King James Bible must still continue to be the Bible for the present&nbsp;time. </p>
<ul><li>Inspiration: The Autographs are 100% infallible, inspired and&nbsp;perfect.</li>
<li>Preservation: Overall the Word of God is preserved through time, specifically in the King James&nbsp;Bible. </li>
<li>The KJB text: The KJB text is&nbsp;correct. </li>
<li>The text in English: The Bible text is fully presented in&nbsp;English. </li>
<li>The KJB translation: Correct, but it is impossible to translate 100%,even though what it does translate is indeed&nbsp;valid. </li>
<li>The KJB language/style: Very good, but if the English language changes,alterations on the current English of the KJB may be&nbsp;necessary. </li>
<li>The perfection of the KJB: The KJB is faithful and reliable, and will never lead anyone&nbsp;astray. </li>
<li>Other versions: No other present English versions are&nbsp;acceptable. </li>
<li>Other languages: The Word of God can continue to be translated into other languages if they are done from the basis of the TR or from the&nbsp;KJB. </li>
</ul><p>The future of the KJB: The KJB will continue to be used by a faithful minority of believers, and may, in the unknown future before the return of Christ, be yet altered in regards to the English only, and not the underlying&nbsp;texts. </p>
<p>Which edition of the KJB: Cambridge Edition best, but any&nbsp;edition. </p>
<h2>CLASS THREE: KING JAMES BIBLE PURIST (ENGLISH&nbsp;PRESERVATIONIST)</h2>
<p>History: Because for many years the King James Bible was used, and due to tradition and conservative forces, that Bible has continued to have been used by true believers. The principles of modernism are deficient, and the King James Bible is the providentially appointed correct Bible for the&nbsp;world. </p>
<ul><li>Inspiration: The Autographs are 100% infallible, inspired and&nbsp;perfect. </li>
<li>Preservation: The Word of God is preserved through time, specifically in the King James&nbsp;Bible. </li>
<li>The KJB text: The KJB text is&nbsp;correct. </li>
<li>The text in English: The Bible text is fully presented in&nbsp;English. </li>
<li>The KJB translation: Fully perfect, equivalent to the originals in&nbsp;English. </li>
<li>The KJB language/style: Exact, no updating or changes are to be&nbsp;accepted. </li>
<li>The perfection of the KJB: The KJB is&nbsp;inerrant. </li>
<li>Other versions: No other present English versions are&nbsp;acceptable. </li>
<li>Other languages: With the world becoming conversant with English, the King James Bible alone is now to be promoted as the only form of the Bible for the whole&nbsp;world. </li>
</ul><p>The future of the KJB: The KJB will continue to be used by a faithful minority of believers, and that by true revival, be restabilised as the Bible of the true Church throughout the&nbsp;Earth. </p>
<p>Which edition of the KJB: The Cambridge Edition generally, the Pure Cambridge Edition&nbsp;specifically. </p>
<h2>CLASS FOUR: KING JAMES BIBLE EXTREMIST (SOME IS USED AS&nbsp;SLANDER)</h2>
<p>History: Because the Apostle Paul used the King James Bible, so should true believers&nbsp;today. </p>
<ul><li>Inspiration: The Autographs are irrelevant. The King James Bible itself was made by inspired men from 1604-1611, and is advanced&nbsp;revelation. </li>
<li>Preservation: The King James Bible is the Word of&nbsp;God. </li>
<li>The KJB text: The KJB text is&nbsp;correct. </li>
<li>The text in English: The Bible text is fully presented in&nbsp;English. </li>
<li>The KJB translation: Superior to the&nbsp;originals. </li>
<li>The KJB language/style: Exact in all&nbsp;editions. </li>
<li>The perfection of the KJB: The KJB is inerrant in all&nbsp;editions. </li>
<li>Other versions: No other present English versions are&nbsp;acceptable. </li>
<li>Other languages: Since the KJB is necessary for salvation, it is the Word for the&nbsp;world. </li>
</ul><p>The future of the KJB: The KJB will continue to be used by a faithful minority of believers, until it is finally destroyed by the New World Order,&nbsp;etc. </p>
<p>Which edition of the KJB: Any edition, but the Cambridge Edition&nbsp;preferred.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s a good summary of the various positions, and highlights some
common viewpoints. We’ll add one more class, Class Zero (those holding
the superiority of the “modern” versions).</p>
<h2>CLASS ZERO: ANY TRANSLATION IS ACCEPTABLE</h2>
<p>History: The King James Version was good for its time, but it’s
difficult to read thus people today should abandon it and use modern
translations exclusively. Additionally, the Alexandrian texts are
superior scholarship over Textus Receptus.</p>
<ul>
<li>Inspiration: The Autographs are 100% infallible, inspired and
perfect, but due to textual variants scholarship determines what the
autographs are.</li>
<li>Preservation: Overall the Word of God is preserved through time.</li>
<li>The KJB text: The KJB text is far from the best translation, and
modern versions are superior.</li>
<li>The text in English: No better than any other language.</li>
<li>The KJB translation: Good for it’s time, but now archaic.</li>
<li>The KJB language/style: Used in 1611, but must be updated for
today’s reader.</li>
<li>The perfection of the KJB: The KJB was good for its time.</li>
<li>Other versions: Other versions are valid or acceptable,
and preferred.</li>
<li>Other languages: The Word of God should continue to be translated
into other languages.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re somewhere between Class One and Class Two. After studying the
Alexandrian and Textus Receptus (as well as Westcott and Hort), it’s
obvious Textus Receptus forms the correct textual base, but the KJV
isn’t a perfect translation (none is). Class zero lacks historical
evidence as it was only in the last century or so the Alexandrian
manuscripts became popular.</p>
<p>Some of those who believe KJV-Only claim it’s God’s perfect Word, so
much so we no longer have need of Greek or Hebrew. This claim becomes
repeated often, but we’ve yet to see any evidence supporting it. How did
God authenticate the KJV as the perfect translation? If the KJV is the
perfect Bible, did the church lack God’s word for 2,000 years?</p>
<p>Class three and four positions lack evidence as well. Anyone performing
translation work knows it’s <em>impossible</em> to translate one language to
another perfectly. If the Greek is perfect, it’s impossible for a
translation to be (additionally, Greek is a precise language, English
much less so). Thus, the KJV can’t be inerrant compared to the original
Greek and Hebrew.</p>
<p>Of course, those thinking the modern translations (based on the corrupt
Westcott/Hort editions) are equally wrong. The newer translations all
follow Westcott/Hort, some more, some less. (Note: Westcott/Hort’s Greek
text is commonly called Nestle/Aland or UBS [United Bible Society] now —
look in the introductions to see which text your translation used).</p>
<p>In the end, you need balance. The KJV is an excellent translation, but
it’s neither inerrant nor perfect. <em>Any</em> translation (done correctly)
from the Textus Receptus text would be acceptable. If you’ve used the
New King James version, it’s a valid update to the venerable King James.
While it’s not perfect (no translation is), it avoids the corrupt
Gnostic influences of the Alexandrian texts Westcott and Hort used.</p>
<h2>Recommendation</h2>
<p>We’re supporters of Textus Receptus, but not necessarily “KJV-Only”.
<em>Any</em> translation using Textus Receptus would be acceptable.
Unfortunately most of the modern translations use the corrupt
Westcott-Hort texts. If the old language of the KJV gives you problems,
try the
<a href="http://www.christianbook.com/Christian/Books/easy_find/916693141?nav_search=1&amp;A=483672&amp;Au=product.endeca_rollup&amp;An=5100+0&amp;action=Search">1967 Scofield KJV</a>
version (<strong>not</strong> “Old Scofield” or “Scofield III” — they don’t have
language updates). It has language updates right in the text,
for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are
alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not <del>prevent</del>
<ins>precede</ins> them which are asleep. (1 Thessalonians 4:15)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Prevent” in 1611 means what “precede” means today. The 1967 Scofield
makes the change right in the text, while giving the original KJV word
in the marginal notes. As a side note, you can always tell a KJV-Only
person who hasn’t done their homework if they cite this verse as an
example of corruption in modern versions. Precede <em>is</em> the correct
translation, as meaning come before. Prevent in 1611 meant pre-event, or
come before, not hinder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only let your <del>conversation</del> <ins>conduct</ins> be as it becometh
the gospel of Christ; that whether I come and see you, or else be
absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit,
with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;
(Philippians 1:27)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Conversation” had a wider meaning in 1611, meaning conduct. Once again,
the 1967 Scofield updates prove correct.</p>
<p>Naturally, for some KJV-only people, using Scofield’s 1967 version is
heresy as anything not 100% original KJV is unacceptable (they debate
among themselves the Oxford verses Cambridge rendering of the KJV, among
other issues). Unfortunately, they’re quite wrong. An examination of
typesetting techniques of 1611 reveal some interesting characteristics
as words spelling or grammar could be changed for no reason other than
to fit on the line better.</p>
<p>Several versions of Scofield’s work exist — the 1967 used to be called
“New Scofield” when it was originally published, with the reprint titled
“1967 Scofield”. Check and be sure the above verses exist as we’ve noted
to be sure you’re getting the version with language changes.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
