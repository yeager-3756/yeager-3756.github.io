It is our policy to respect your privacy regarding any personal information we may collect while operating our websites.

## Use of Information

We do not rent, sell, or trade personal information for marketing purposes (we don’t like spam either).

### Information we may Collect

*   Subscribing to our newsletter requires an email address used to send the newsletter (each newsletter contains information on how to unsubscribe).
*   Any other volunteered information.
*   Standard Web Log Files and Web Analytics (see below).

#### Log Files and Analytics

Like most websites, we collect non-personally-identifying information of the type web browsers and servers typically make available, such as browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each request. 

We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses as part of standard web logs and analytics programs for security, detecting unauthorized access attempts, determining popular pages, etc. We have configured our analytics software to not set tracking cookies, so the “do not track” setting in your browser (on or off) does not change this site’s behavior, as we don’t set or use tracking cookies.

##### Aggregated Statistics

We collect statistics about the behavior of visitors. We may display aggregated information publicly or provide it to others, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the website.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors choose to interact in ways that require us to gather personally-identifying information (commenting on articles, subscribing to the newsletter, purchasing products, etc). The amount and type of information gathered depends on the nature of the interaction. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

This website is not directed to children under 13, and minors should never enter personal information on this (or any other) site.

### Third Party Utilities

Other privacy policies which may apply to you:

* [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/) - because we use them for the email newsletter
* [YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7671399) - because we embed YouTube Videos
* [Google](https://policies.google.com/privacy) - because we use Google's engine for site search

Any other third party service will have their own privacy policy.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

We do not sell or trade your identifiable information for marketing purposes. We may release information to comply with the law, enforce our policies, or protect our rights.

## Cookies

We may use cookies to help visitors use the website, for web analytics, user preferences, and other uses. Visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies, with the drawback that certain features may not function properly without the aid of cookies (shopping carts typically require cookies, for example). Your browser settings accepting or refusing cookies states your acceptance to opt-in or opt-out of accepting cookies.

This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by us and does not cover any third parties as each have their own privacy policy.

## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, we may change this Privacy Policy from time to time in our sole discretion and will post changes on this page, along with the date modified. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
