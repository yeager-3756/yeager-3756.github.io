## Why We’re Here

To discuss the Bible, politics, science, and religion — not simply reporting news, but how it fits together to affect your life.
We’ll frequently refer to a 3AM phone call — you might remember Hillary Clinton’s political ad.

> It’s 3AM and your children are safe and asleep. But there’s a phone in
> the White House and it’s ringing. Something’s happening in the world …
> who do you want answering the phone?

How does a political ad relate to your Christian life? At 3AM you don’t have anyone to lean on.
Are you prepared?
Or [living in The Matrix]({% post_url 2011-09-16-matrix-guide-christianity %})?
We present a collection of resources on the Bible, Christian living, politics, atheism, and science, differing from other blogs in a few ways:

1.  The majority of content relates to a simple question: **Will *you*
    be ready to answer the call at 3AM?** Because at 3AM you’ve got what
    you’ve got.
2.  While we *do* cover some current events, **it’s not a news site, but
    rather how events relate to your life**, Bible prophecy, and the
    future.
3.  **Don’t expect large volume of posts**. 4–6 per month is a normal
    frequency. We’re more interested in *how* news and science relates
    to you than simply reporting what you already hear from dozens of
    other sources.

## Who Cares About That?


Well, *you* should.

Too many Christians face trials and crisis, and when they look in their toolbox for something to use, they find nothing. We want to change that.

**Our goal is to make this your go-to reference for filling your toolbox.** Because you *will* have those 3AM moments, the only question will be how you handle them.

Filling your toolbox requires Bible knowledge, but also science, logic, and attitude, and Christians must transition from beginner to black-belt.
It’s time to **get off the sideline, and get in the game**.
