  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Life is hard. I tend to write about trials because that’s real life;
life stinks sometimes (honest, I don’t make this stuff up). Many times
we face a situation and must decide which way to go — the easy way or
the hard way? It’s easier to take the wide path than stand your ground.
Yet how would Jesus handle the same situation? Would He bail out? Or stay
the course? Would He think of others? Or Himself?</p>
<p>A doctrine blows through churches saying the Christian life is easy;
Jesus wants you to have a new car, a big house, and a Lexus.
Unfortunately that false doctrine ignores most of the church experiences through most
of the last two thousand years — suffering for standing up for what’s
right. But if Jesus is our example, what life did He lead? Did He ever
promise us an easy life? Sometimes life is hard; choosing the right
path takes courage, determination and commitment.</p>
<p>But the response to commitment and responsibility uncovers a
problem; we haven’t learned from Jesus’ example and lose our sense of
duty and commitment, instead getting our theology from TV (You deserve a
break today, you know). I don’t understand how people can walk away from
their children and say they’re done with them. I don’t understand how you
can walk out on your spouse because you think they’re not what you thought
(or wanted). Too many people only live for themselves — and that’s not
the way Jesus taught us.</p>
<p>I just don’t get it. Granted, I’m an old guy from a different time,
but the thought of walking out on kids just doesn’t register in my
brain. I just don’t see how anyone could ever hurt a child, walk out on them,
or mistreat them. But it’s not just that. How many marriages end in
divorce because someone became disillusioned or ran into tough times? (Of
course, nobody ever says to stay in an abusive relationship or remain if your
safety is in danger). But how many times do we hear the (in)famous “I
don’t love you anymore”? If you ever hear that phrase, it means love
never really existed, because love isn’t an emotion, it’s a commitment, and
a commitment (by definition) can’t be undone.</p>
<p>Commitment. That’s what’s lacking today. Agape is not an emotion,
it’s a commitment. If you love your kids, you’ll never abandon them or
hurt them. You’ll <em>never</em> cheat on your spouse. Those things just
aren’t possible. That doesn’t mean we won’t make mistakes or have
problems, but quitting isn’t an option — it must not be in your vocabulary.</p>
<p>I wonder if Jesus had the lack of commitment common today —
would we still be saved? I doubt it. No doubt He didn’t
<em>want</em> to go to Calvary, He did it because of His commitment
to us. Does Jesus look down today and have His heart broken as He sees
our lack of commitment? Too many marriages end in divorce. Too many
pregnancies end in abortion. Too many projects left incomplete. Too much work
undone. Too much self.</p>
<p>When Jesus said to take up your cross, what are we to take up? Jesus
says to take up your cross (daily) and follow Him. How do we do that?
What is our cross? I’ve heard people say something like “I’ve got cancer,
it’s just the cross I have to bear”. Certainly I don’t want to belittle
those sick or having hard times, but is that what Jesus speaks of? Does He
speak of situations out of your control? I don’t think so. Jesus’ cross
wasn’t something out of His control (remember He controlled the entire
situation), so what must we learn?</p>
<p>Recall back in the garden, as Jesus was about to be arrested, beaten
and crucified. What did He pray to the Father? <em>Father, if there be
any other way to save man, let’s take it.</em> He didn’t
<em>want</em> to go to Calvary, He was committed. And that’s the
key for us; the cross is a choice, not a situation. It’s dedication to
the Father. It’s commitment.</p>
<p>Commitment. Today we treat it like a dirty word, but what if Jesus
quit? Reading His prayer in the garden and the agony of what He knew
was about to transpire, He certainly didn’t look forward to it. Yet He
stayed the course, not because it was easy, but because it was the right thing
to do. Commitment, that’s the cross He speaks of. It’s a choice you make
to do the right thing, even if it’s painful. Psalm 15 says “He who keeps an
oath even when it hurts, and doesn’t change (Psalm 15:4 WEB)”. That’s the
cross. It’s commitment even when it’s not what <em>you</em> want.</p>
<p>We’ve been through the greatest generation, the baby boomer
generation, the flower children generation, and generation x. But
today we’re in a new phase, generation “I”. As in “I want this” and “I don’t
want to do that”. It’s what causes abortion, because <em>I</em>
don’t want a child right now. It’s the divorce because <em>I’m</em>
not happy in my marriage, so it’s ok if <em>I</em> quit and find
someone else. <em>I</em> don’t have time for the Lord’s work,
<em>I</em> need a new Lexus.</p>
<p>Perhaps our problem stems from our misunderstanding of love (in
Biblical terms). Agape is a commitment, not an emotion. If you base
your love for your spouse on feelings, what happens when that feeling isn’t
there? What happens during an argument? Agape is a commitment, not an
emotion. It means doing the right thing, which isn’t always fun or
what <em>I</em> want. It means others come first, and I come last (Men,
it means your family comes first — you’re the leader of the house
whether you want to be or not).</p>
<p>We hear a lot about self image problems today, and they’re
right — we have <em>way</em> too much. It’s what
<em>I</em> want, right now, and it doesn’t matter who it hurts.
That’s a real self image problem, and it’s called pride. We have too
much pride and not enough commitment.</p>
<p>Jesus didn’t quit (although He certainly could have). But where
would we be? What would happen if Jesus lacked commitment? It didn’t
take much to create the cosmos so we couldn’t blame Him for scrapping it
and starting over; He certainly suffered more than we ever will, so we have
no right to complain. When we lack commitment we forgot what our job is.
Fortunately, Paul reminds us.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus
Christ. No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of
this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier. (2 Timothy 2:3-4 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our job is a soldier of Christ. Not always fun, not
always easy. Yet we’re called to that mission, and quitting isn’t an
option. Growing up I recall a poster my parents gave me of a football
player, all alone on the bench, hunched over holding his helmet. He’s
dirty and a little bloody sitting all alone. And in big letters across the
top it said “I QUIT!” But in tiny print at the bottom, it said “I
didn’t — Jesus Christ”.</p>
<p>Yet today we live in a disposable society. Disposable kids,
disposable marriages, disposable DVD players, disposable TV’s. If
you’re older you remember something called a TV repair shop. When it broke,
you fixed it. Today TV’s are disposable. Sadly, we treat marriage the same
way. When it’s not functioning correctly, instead of fixing it we just
dispose of it and get another.</p>
<p>The cause for this malady is simple; we don’t have correct
perspective. We’re a soldier of Christ; a soldier’s life is a battle.
You get muddy and your circumstances aren’t always what you want. A
soldier doesn’t live like royalty, and isn’t concerned with getting a Lexus.
It’s about commitment. As a soldier, in Paul’s final instruction to his
protege Timothy, he reminds us how we should look back on our life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I
have kept the faith (2 Timothy 4:7 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’re in a race — finish well. That means holding on, not quitting, and
working through the pain. It means
giving up what you want for what your family needs. It means picking
up your cross and following Jesus. It means running the race with
endurance, knowing it’s a long race and unpleasant situations occur.</p>
<p>Everyone wants joy and happiness in life; too many people look for
joy in the wrong place. You won’t find it in possessions, wealth or
power (If you could, Solomon would have been the happiest guy on earth). You
won’t find it looking inward, but outward. It’s Jesus first, others
next and you last. That’s joy.</p>
<p>Part of commitment requires stubbornness (which gets a bad rap
sometimes). It’s the attitude no matter what happens, I won’t quit,
you can’t fire me, and I’m not going to resign. Too many people treat
commitment like a DVD player. When it’s not working right anymore, toss
it out and get a new one. Commitment follows Winston Churchill’s famous
words (for you young guys, he’s from WWII).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we
shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing
confidence
and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever
the
cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the
landing
grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall
fight in
the hills; we shall never surrender …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I watched a movie recently about penguins
(March of the Penguins - bet you’ve been wondering when
I’d get around to it). Penguins are interesting creatures. During
their life they’ll walk seventy miles to a barren place far away from the
ocean, where the female lays her egg. At this point she’s close to starvation,
and must immediately return the 70 miles to the ocean to get food.</p>
<p>So the guy steps in, placing the egg on his short feet and covering
it so it stays warm. During the winter as storms rage all around, he
never loses the egg. It’s quite a site to see hundreds of penguins huddled in
a mass, each one taking a turn standing on the outside to break the wind
so the ones inside can stay warm.</p>
<p>After the female returns, it’s his turn to make the 70 mile trek to
the ocean for food. They alternate back and forth, each taking turns
keeping the egg warm, and getting food. As spring comes (months later),
the egg hatches, and a little baby penguin is born (cigars all around).
You then know why they trekked 70 miles inland — as the ice begins to
melt, that 70 miles becomes just a few hundred yards; the young
penguins have only a small journey to the ocean, yet aren’t near the melting
ice which could endanger them.</p>
<p>Thus the penguins life continue. Quite a commitment. What if they
had commitment like today? Gee, sitting on this egg is a real downer,
<em>I</em> want to go swimming! I’m hungry! This egg thing is
uncomfortable! I deserve a break today.</p>
<p>They’d be extinct rather quickly, don’t you think? But if a penguin
shows commitment, can’t we? Can’t we stick it out when the going gets
tough? After considering what Jesus went through for us, is it
unreasonable to be a little more committed?</p>
<p>We all have a cross to bear — choices we make in life which
sometimes aren’t fun, yet are the right thing to do. In the Bible,
Jesus is the supreme example of commitment. Maybe you can’t be like Jesus, but
how about Paul? Or Peter? Or John? All through the Bible we have examples
of commitment in the face of adversity. Don’t quit — stand your ground
through the storm. But if you can’t be like any of those, at least …</p>
<p>… be a Penguin.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
