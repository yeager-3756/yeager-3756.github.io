  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>In the atheism verses God debate, one thorny issue always remains for
the atheist — how does the atheist define morality (right and wrong)?
Without absolute standards, where does right and wrong come from?
Consider the atheist’s favorite spokesman Richard Dawkins speaking on
the question of morality.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://byfaithonline.com/page/in-the-world/richard-dawkins-the-atheist-evangelist">
<p>“What defines your morality?” I asked with genuine&nbsp;curiosity.</p>
<p>There was an extended pause as Dawkins considered the question carefully. “Moral philosophic reasoning and a shifting zeitgeist.” He looked off and then continued. “We live in a society in which, nowadays, slavery is abominated, women are respected, children can’t be abused—all of which is different from previous centuries.” He leaned forward as he warmed to his&nbsp;subject.</p>
<p>At this point, perhaps a word of explanation is necessary. Zeitgeist is a German word meaning “spirit of the age.” Dawkins here refers to the prevailing moral climate or mood of a given place or time. We may observe that what constitutes moral or ethical behavior differs from one culture to another; indeed, it may even differ within a given culture. This is not in dispute. The question, rather, is this: should moral standards be based on the societal zeitgeist or should they look beyond it to something&nbsp;else?</p>
<p>I asked an obvious question: “As we speak of this shifting zeitgeist, how are we to determine who’s right? If we do not acknowledge some sort of external [standard], what is to prevent us from saying that the Muslim [extremists] aren’t&nbsp;right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, absolutely fascinating.” His response was immediate. “<b>What’s to prevent us from saying Hitler wasn’t right?</b>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How do you obtain moral standards?</p>
<ol>
<li>Human thinking by changing times (zeitgeist).</li>
<li>Outside human thought, i.e. God.</li>
</ol>
<p>Atheists may think of morality as coming from instinct, majority of
opinion, situationally up to each person, and so on, but as Dawkins
admits any and all of those are subject to change. Thus it’s up to each
individual to determine morality, and as Dawkins notes, by that logic
who can say Hitler was wrong in exterminating six million Jews? No
absolutes exist, so everything is moral … and immoral at the same time.</p>
<p>This does <em>not</em> imply atheists can’t be good people — they certainly can
be. But it <em>does</em> mean they have no absolute standard for morality, and
ultimately moral actions come down to situational ethics — what’s moral
today could be immoral tomorrow, and vice versa — morality needs an
absolute standard or it varies as each person or majority decide
morality for themselves or the group. But in either case
morality shifts.</p>
<p>Dawkins’ idea even <em>suggesting</em> Hitler could have been right displays
the absurdity of the atheist position. Without an absolute moral
compass, anything can be considered moral at one point, and not at
another. In Dawkins’ atheist reality, it’s <em>possible</em> for Hitler’s
actions to be correct, now or in the future. In other words, morals are
not absolute at any time — the perfect storm of situational ethics.</p>
<p>Naturally, Dawkins’ suggestion about Hitler likely repulses most (all?)
people, but while many atheists might attempt verbal twister to avoid
the conclusion, Dawkins gets credit for not denying the logical
conclusion of his atheist position and the lack of standard morality
it spawns.</p>
<p>Why this position doesn’t bother him remains troubling.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
