  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Perhaps one of the oldest questions is <em>Why is there evil in the world?</em>
Or to put it a different way, <em>why do bad things happen to good people?</em>
Where do we go for answers; what’s our authority? The Bible. But what
exactly does the Bible say about such things? Certainly the most common
answer we here is from the book of Job. There is much to learn there,
but from a practical standpoint, but how do we use this information?
Let’s look at two people of the bible, and what they had to say.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…there was given me a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to
torment me. Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from
me. (2 Cor 12:7-8 NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is Paul talking, the guy who wrote a significant part of the New
Testament. While we may argue exactly what Paul’s thorn was, apparently
he prayed three times for it to be removed, and each time the answer was
no. Let’s also look at David, the author of many Psalms. In Psalm 22
he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me? Why are You so far from
helping Me, And from the words of My groaning? O My God, I cry in the
daytime, but You do not hear; And in the night season, and am not
silent. (Psalms 22:1-2 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, we know Psalm 22 is a Psalm prophesying about Jesus Christ. Still,
what situation could David have been in to cause him so much grief?
These two people lead us to point #1.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Point #1</strong> - If two giants of the bible suffered and had problems,
you are not alone if you have them. This is not a uniquely New or Old
Testament situation, everyone suffers through trials sometimes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first thing to note is, <em>you are not alone</em>. Everyone suffers
through problems and trials at some point or another. Another common
problem is we view trials as God’s punishment of us. This was
essentially Job’s condition. His friends told him he must have sinned
against God for this much disaster to strike him. As we read the book of
Job, we find out who was really responsible for his disasters (Satan, -
read chapter one of Job). But this still doesn’t solve our problem, why
do these things happen? The answer lies in the following.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my
ways,” declares the LORD. “As the heavens are higher than the earth,
so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your
thoughts.” (Isaiah 55:8-9 NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which leads us naturally to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Point #2</strong>: The answer to the question of why bad things happen to
good people is (drumroll please…) - <span class="Underline">I have
no idea!</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, before you abandon me totally, allow me to expand on the previous
idea. Many times we have a strange idea that we should understand
everything around us. As we learn from Quantum Physics, the more we
learn, the more we realize the less we know. Imagine, it’s taken
scientists thousands of years to catch up to Isaiah! But the point is,
some knowledge is simply beyond our understanding. While we can
speculate and debate about many things, sometimes the answer is simply
“I don’t know”. Sadly, as humans our response so frequently is “That’s
not good enough”. However, God says so, so if you have a problem with
it, I suggest you take it up with him.</p>
<p>So, now that we have answered the age-old question (and in only about a
page - it’s amazing how many “problems” are really no problem when
viewed with a biblical mind-set), our new question becomes “What do we
do now?” As usual, the Bible shows the answer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trust in the LORD with all your heart, And lean not on your own
understanding (Proverbs 3:5 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, something we can apply in our life! This is the crux of the
issue. As Chuck Missler says (If I quote correctly) “It’s amazing how
far the Lord goes to ask the question ’Do you trust me’?” And what is
our response? “Lord, I don’t know how this situation could work out, I’m
in big trouble here!” If we can’t figure a way out, we don’t see how God
can. Perhaps (just perhaps) many of our problems are simply God’s way of
getting our attention. This leads to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Point #3</strong> - When faced with a situation you don’t understand,
Rejoice! It is precisely these events that God uses to show his Power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps you’ve heard the saying, “God helps those who help themselves”.
Actually, God helps those who are <em>incapable</em> of helping themselves. By
ourselves, we have no power. But through Him, we can do anything.
Consider Daniel in the lions den, and his three friends in the fiery
furnace. Moses and the Red Sea. Jesus and Lazarus. In all of these
situations, the people involved had no power of their own to solve the
situation. But looking to God, and the problem is solved. <em>“Behold, I am
the LORD</em>*,** the God of all flesh. Is there anything too hard for Me?
(Jeremiah 32:27 NKJV)*</p>
<p>And lest you think that God ever forgets about you and your problems,
Jesus himself spoke of the Father’s love for us in the Sermon on
the Mount:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you will
eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will put on.
Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing? “Look at
the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into
barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value
than they? (Matthew 6:25-26 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul also has practical information in the same passage where he was
praying for his thorn to be removed, where he records the Lord’s
response to his request.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And He said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is
made perfect in weakness.” Therefore most gladly I will rather boast
in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.
Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in
persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake. For when I am weak,
then I am strong. (2 Corinthians 12:9-10 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s review what we have learned.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, trials and suffering are not yours alone. The Bible is full
of people being brought through various trials.</li>
<li>Second, God says some things are beyond our understanding. The fact
we don’t understand something should not bother us.</li>
<li>Third, nothing is too difficult for God, and he is completely aware
of our problems.</li>
<li>Lastly, look at what Paul wrote again. For when I am weak, then I am
strong. As long as we trust in the Lord, there is nothing to fear.</li>
</ul>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
