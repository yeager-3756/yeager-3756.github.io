  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<blockquote>
<p>So you wanna go back to Egypt, where it’s warm and secure.<br />
Are you sorry you bought the one way ticket<br />
when you thought you were sure?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s strange how we only remember the good parts of the “good ol’ days”;
all the bad events become lost in the vast space of gray matter. Perhaps
that’s why drug addicts have a hard time shaking the habit — it’s
because they forgot the hangovers, jail time, and wasting all their
money on a stupid habit that takes and takes but never gives back.</p>
<p>I think this is another on satan’s short list of favorite tactics. You
see, first he persecutes you for <em>being</em> a Christian, and then reminds
you what a great life you had <em>before</em> you were a Christian. The
temptation to give up and return to the old life exists simply because
many people travel that friendly and social path — the end of which is
death. A Permanent, eternal, unpleasant end.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So you wanna go back to Egypt, where old friends wait for you.<br />
You can throw a big party and tell the whole gang,<br />
That what they said was all true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Yeah, I tried that God stuff — it didn’t work for me”. How many times
have <em>you</em> heard that? How many times have you <em>thought</em> that? I thought
so. Your old friends always remind you of the good times (conveniently
omitting all the bad), trying to pull you back while wishing they
themselves could climb out of the tar pit they fell into.</p>
<p>We always desire to go back. The Israelites faced a similar problem as
they departed from Egypt; upon arriving at the promised land they
decided not to go in. Why? It’s too tough — there are giants in the
land! And Egypt — my how our life was better back then! Slavery? Well,
yeah, that was a bummer, but the food was good! (And we know from the
story of Esau what people will sell for a pot of stew, or drink,
or fix).</p>
<p>Not believing the promises of God they wasted 40 years. This is another
of satan’s tactics — getting us to waste our time. Instead of pushing on
in our service to God we believe what we can see with our eyes (the
giants before us) and forget what we can’t see (the invisible warriors
lined up beside us). If you need a review, read 2 Kings chapter six —
Elisha knew what was there all along, while his servant only believed
what he could see. (We need to be aware of the multi-dimensional space
we inhabit. While we are aware of only four dimensions, we live in at
least ten. Second Kings chapter six shows what goes on in the other
six dimensions).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You wanted to live in the Land of Promise, but now it’s getting so
hard. Are you sorry you’re out here in the desert, instead of your
own backyard?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When God calls you out of the world and into the promised land it’s time
to get moving! But we get too much of our theology from TV. Oh, you’ve
seen the type — just come to Jeeeesus and life will be good. Marriage in
trouble? Give it to Jeeeeesus. Want a bigger house? Pray to Jeeeesus.
And of course they imply if you’re still in trouble it’s because you
didn’t have enough faith. (I wonder what these guys would tell Paul —
did he lack faith to get his thorn removed? I wouldn’t want to be the
one to tell Paul).</p>
<p>These rose-colored glasses cause the problem. (I must point out this
problem exists primarily in the United States as Christians in other
countries don’t have it nearly as easy as we do — they don’t fall victim
to what Walter Martin called “easy believism”). Somehow we believe the
Christian life is supposed to be easy. But it’s not. Triumphant, yes,
but easy, no. The Christian life is a battleground — but sometimes we
think it’s too hard and want to go back to before we were born again —
we’re always drawn to go back.</p>
<p>But by who? Certainly not God. Could it be perhaps satan? Israel
remembered the leeks and onions and forgot the slavery. What about you?
What is satan reminding you of? Something you’d be better off without,
I’m sure. Satan has a way of making us forget the bad stuff while
reminding us of all the good times. You know, the life of the party
while forgetting about the great white porcelain god (or the next
morning). And sure, if you quit satan will leave you alone and stop
bothering you, so in some sense life would be easier. Sin is always easy
— for a season. But when the bill comes due, look out. It must be paid
in full, no monthly payments allowed. It might be tempting to go back,
but why listen to satan for advice? He’s a liar and deceiver.</p>
<p>Israel’s (and our) problem is we don’t understand the analogy used in
the Old Testament. The promised land is NOT an analogy for heaven as
many people think. Battles loom, along with some defeats, setbacks and
casualties. Do you think heaven will be like that? I don’t think so.
Once you get the analogy straightened out you’ll begin to understand
your current situation much better. Don’t expect an easy life as a
Christian — you’ll be disappointed. Expect trials, problems
and persecution.</p>
<p>Life is hard. But you and God are a majority in any group; you’re in the
promised land — why go anywhere else?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmovable, always
abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your
labor is not in vain in the Lord. (1 Corinthians 15:58 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“So you wanna go Back to Egypt” Keith Green, Sparrow Records 1980</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
