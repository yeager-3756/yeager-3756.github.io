  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>There comes a time in everyone’s life when they are at the crossroads —
standing at the “Y” in the road — before them two different paths. You
can only choose one path, and it’s clear these paths lead in different
directions in different ways. As the crisp autumn breeze blows in your
face, you must decide which path to choose. Winter is coming soon, and
you can’t stay here forever. You must make a choice. You can’t see very
far down either road, and each looks similar, yet different. One slopes
gently downward, it’s path covered with small stones which crunch under
your feet. It’s a wide path, and looks well traveled by many people
before you. Curious though, no one is around to ask about it. You hear
the wind whistling through the evergreen trees as you study this path,
trying to decide if you should take it or not.</p>
<p>The other path is narrower, and looks considerably less traveled. It’s
curiously devoid of stones across it’s trail; it starts level, then
changes to a gradual incline as it spirals out of sight — off to the
left away from the other path. It almost appears as if it touches the
clouds. The wind blows harder as you take a few steps to get a glimpse
of what lies beyond. It doesn’t look very inviting, in fact, it has no
traits to make you want to choose it. From this vantage point, you can
tell not many people choose to travel this path.</p>
<p>The two paths are different, yet you instinctively know each holds a
different destiny. What lies along each path? Why isn’t anyone here to
help you? Shouldn’t there be a guide to help you choose? But none
appears, and no one is available to help you make your choice. As you
stand there, the wind becomes colder; dirt begins to blow in your face.
You can’t stay here any more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How much would it take to wash me clean? How much would it take to
make me whole? I know it would take more than anything to save my
soul<sup>*</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you take a few steps back and look at both, and obviously the wide
path wins. It’s been well traveled, and many people trek down its
gravel-covered path. Taking a few steps down it, you can see other
people off in the distance laughing and having a good time — in a lush
green meadow just at the base of a giant mountain, where the path curves
behind and out of sight.</p>
<p>Which path do you choose?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How much would it take to bear the pain of all the sin that I am
guilty of? Tell me who on earth has ever found That kind of love<sup>*</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is essentially your choice before you. But before you answer, you
must consider one critical issue not yet known to you — what lies at the
end of each path? You see, judging from your initial inspection doesn’t
tell you the ultimate destiny. It’s sad people never consider what lies
ahead for them, but only choose based on first impressions, assuming the
remainder of their path follows under similar conditions. But is that
true? These two paths divert away from each other — you know going from
one path to the other is difficult at best — and the farther down a
certain path you travel, the more difficult it is to find the other
path. What lies ahead on this inviting, wide, obviously
well-traveled path?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How much would it cost to set me free? How much would it take to lead
me home? Tell me who can make a blind man see I need to know.<sup>*</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Standing at the “Y” in the road, you might as well be blind. You have no
way of knowing from your current position what each path leads to. You
need a guide, someone who’s been up ahead, and can advise you of
setbacks and rough areas in the road ahead. Just then, two people
claiming to be guides appear from behind you, both trying to convince
you to choose one path over the other.</p>
<p>The first speaks softly, with well-worn hands — you can tell he’s the
kind of person who doesn’t have many possessions and works with his
hands a lot. He’s not very articulate, yet his words seem to have a
weight you’ve never heard before. He’s dressed in simple clothes (his
large coat sleeves extending past his wrists), and by them you can see
he’s only familiar with the narrow path, the path he subtly suggests you
follow. When you inquire of him about the other path, he just says it’s
up to you, you can choose either path — but he won’t go down the wide
path with you. If you choose him as your guide, the choice of path is
made for you. He doesn’t seem to be a very good salesman.</p>
<p>But the other guide dresses in flashy clothes, and seems to know about
both paths. He confirms what you have already suspected, the wide path
is the most popular — he’s sent many people previously down it. He
reminds you what you saw off in the distance — people having a good
time. He definitely has an opinion you should take the well-traveled
wide path, since everyone else chooses it as well. The narrow path?
Well, it’s not very well traveled, and you wouldn’t want to be caught
out in the wilderness alone, would you? After all, it’s a scary place.
He assures you many people follow on his path, and there will be lots of
other people to be with.</p>
<p>Who will you listen to? How can you make your decision? It seems so
obvious which path to be on, yet there’s something about this flashy guy
you just don’t trust. How can he be so sure? The soft spoken man reminds
you if you choose his path, he will stay with you through your journey;
he knows the outback well. Looking at him, you can tell he’s spent a
considerable amount of time navigating out here. His callused hands
speak of his time as a guide — you can tell he’s carried a lot of wood
in his day.</p>
<p>The other guide is a salesman; he makes no promise of guiding you. Why
should I, he says, this path is so easy you don’t need a guide to travel
on it! You wonder where he gets his experience from — it’s clear he’s
not used to the wilderness and looks like he’d be more at ease
continuing this discussion from the comfort of his office. He’s also
noticeably nervous in the presence of the other guide. You wonder why;
it just doesn’t make sense, but he clearly wants to get you away and
continue this alone.</p>
<p>So you stand at the fork in the road, listening, looking, and wondering,
which path is the right one? Which leads to the destination you seek?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the voice of God is speaking and I cannot believe myself “When
there’s nothing left worth seeking, It’s time to trust somebody
else”<sup>*</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You nervously put one foot forward, and make your choice.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
