  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Who’s in your boat? What a strange question — I don’t have a boat, don’t
need a boat, don’t want a boat. As we shall see, it’s a <em>vital</em> question
to ask if we are to grow in our Christian walk. The stories in the
Gospels about the apostles present more than history; they illustrate
lessons we should learn. Taking the time to study them in detail
provides many lessons for us. The story you’re about to read is real;
none of the names have been changed because only one was innocent. We’ll
pick up the story on a typical day after Jesus finished teaching the
multitudes following Him, as Jesus and the disciples are left alone to
travel to their next location.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the same day, when evening had come, He said to them, “Let us cross
over to the other side.” Now when they had left the multitude, they
took Him along in the boat as He was. And other little boats were also
with Him. (Mark 4:35–36 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus tells them to cross over to the other side with Him. Matthew’s
record of this event says “He gave a command to depart to the other side
(Matthew 8:18)” — this was not a suggestion. When Jesus gives a command,
you can be sure there is a purpose — in this case an opportunity for the
disciples to grow (an offer they couldn’t refuse, you might say). And to
their credit, Luke says “they launched out”. There was no question of
Jesus’ authority here; they simply did what they were commanded to do.
How many times do we miss this point? When you get a command from the
Lord, how do you handle it? Do you immediately obey, or put it off?
Recall when Jonah decided to ignore the command of God — he got a little
one-on-one tutoring from the Lord, and the time needed to digest (pun
intended) the lesson!</p>
<p>That’s the first problem we encounter — obeying the voice of God.
Frequently we don’t want to follow where He commands us to go. Or we
start arguing and debating with God, like we know better what to do. It
is better to do what the disciples did; follow His command. But just as
He spoke to the disciples — “let us” — He says the same to us. Wherever
He directs us, He goes with us. We don’t have to fear going alone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And a great windstorm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that
it was already filling. (Mark 4:37 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s important to know these were professional fishermen. They spent
their life on this lake and knew it well. Severe storms on this lake
appeared frequently and caused by the specific geography in the region.
Most likely, they had seen many storms before — but this one was
different. So when they panic, you can be sure it’s a big and
unusual storm.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But He was in the stern, asleep on a pillow. (Mark 4:38a NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ever think God is asleep? Here I am sinking in a storm, my boat filling
with water, and He’s sleeping! That’s not true, of course. The good
shepherd is always watching over His flock. But notice <em>He is with
them.</em> At no point did He ever leave them. With Jesus with you, are you
ever in danger? That’s our lesson. If the creator of the universe says
to cross over, you’re going to make it! As the storms come, it’s easy to
forget this simple point. In the midst of trials, we often forget God
has not abandoned us, and is where He’s always been (and always will be)
— on His throne watching over His people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will lift up my eyes to the hills; From whence comes my help? My
help comes from the LORD, Who made heaven and earth. He will not allow
your foot to be moved; He who keeps you will not slumber. (Psalm
121:1–3 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s important what Jesus <em>didn’t</em> say — He didn’t say it would be
smooth sailing; so many times we only hear what we want to. Many
so-called “Bible teachers” skip promises in the Bible like <em>“In the
world you will have tribulation (John 16:33)”</em> — no promise exists of
smooth sailing in life — just the opposite.</p>
<p>Did Jesus know about the soon to come storm? Of course. But He also knew
the boat would make it to the other side. The question is (if He knew),
why would He deliberately send them into the midst of it? It’s a heresy
to believe if you’re sick or broke or in a trial it’s because God
doesn’t love you or isn’t watching out for you. In this case, Jesus
<em>knowingly</em> sends them into a storm. Why? Perhaps it’s because a lesson
must be learned that can’t be learned any other way. No pain, no gain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And they awoke Him and said to Him, “Teacher, do You not care that we
are perishing?” (Mark 4:38b NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They wake Jesus up, believing they are dying! More than that, they think
Jesus doesn’t care. It’s a problem we often find ourselves in — thinking
God has forgotten us, or worse doesn’t care about our present situation.
But not a bird can fall to the ground without His knowledge. We can be
sure He is aware of everything going on. The problem is we don’t
<em>understand</em> what is going on, and our lack of understanding leads to a
doubt of His looking out for us. God NEVER promises we will <em>understand</em>
everything going on, but <em>does</em> promise that <em>“all things work together
for good to those who love God (Romans 8:28 NKJV)”</em> — and that
includes storms.</p>
<p>Remember, these were professional fishermen; it was their livelihood to
navigate on this lake. The fact they feared for their life meant this
was no average storm. It was fiercer than anything they had ever seen —
this storm was real, and their perceived danger was real. Yet they were
never in any real danger; nothing can happen without the consent of God.
If He doesn’t approve it, it ain’t gonna happen. Jesus said not to fear
anyone who can kill the body, but fear God (Matthew 10:28–31).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then He arose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Peace, be
still!” And the wind ceased and there was a great calm. (Mark
4:39 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a great picture depicting this exact moment I’d love to have.
The storm clouds are still visible, and there are the disciples in this
old boat, with Jesus standing up with His arms outstretched, as if
giving a command. The sea is smooth as glass. Wow. In any event, He says
three words, and everything is calm. It doesn’t matter how fierce the
storm is, a few words from Jesus and it’s gone. Remember that.</p>
<p>Jesus of course knew they were in no real danger. How could they be with
the creator of the universe in the boat with them? Yet we travel each
day with the same advantage they had — and forget it as easily as they
did. If Jesus is in your boat, are you in any danger? Do you remember
that? *”I am with you always, even to the end of the age (Matthew
28:20 NKJV)”.</p>
<p>But it’s curious the phrase Jesus uses — He <em>rebuked</em> the sea. Strange.
You wouldn’t rebuke something inanimate would you? But this storm was
particularly fierce; could it be that satan had his hand in this?
Perhaps. How many of our trials are due to our own stupidity, and how
many are caused by forces aligned with satan? I don’t know. But if this
storm (or a storm you are going through) is satan’s doing, how much
effort did Jesus expend in eliminating satan’s storm? Three words. How
big is your God? Can He take care of <em>all</em> of your needs? <em>“Behold, I am
the LORD, the God of all flesh. Is there anything too hard for Me?</em>
(Jeremiah 32:27 NKJV)”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But He said to them, “Why are you so fearful? How is it that you have
no faith?” (Mark 4:40 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why indeed. If the creator of the universe is in your boat, what can
go wrong?</p>
<p>We assume they lacked faith in His deity. But if that were true, why
would they wake Him up? If you or I were in the boat sleeping, would
they wake us up? No. Why? Because we don’t have the ability to help the
situation. Waking Jesus up was an admission they knew He had the power
to help them. Why then this rebuke? What faith did they lack? They
lacked faith in His plan. Earlier He said “let’s go to the other side”.
They doubted His plan would be carried out.</p>
<p>Faith is important to God. In fact, it is <em>impossible</em> to please Him
without it. (Hebrews 11:6). But like anything else, how do you acquire
faith? By exercising your spiritual muscles. It’s easy to talk about
faith, but just like your physical body, faith diminishes without being
exercised. It’s not something you can acquire without using, or just say
“Today I’m going to have faith”. And just like your muscles, when you
exercise your faith, sometimes you get sore and tired. This storm was a
way for the disciples to have the opportunity to grow — they were never
in any real danger, just exercising their spiritual muscles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And they feared exceedingly, and said to one another, “Who can this
be, that even the wind and the sea obey Him!” (Mark 4:41 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s amazing the guys who lived with Jesus didn’t grasp fully who He was
until later.</p>
<p>The more you think about this small story the more it reveals the nature
of God, our frequent lack of trust in Him, His love, and His provision.
Just like the disciples, we also face severe storms, <em>but we have the
same advantage the disciples did</em> — the creator of the universe is in
our boat as well! How often do we panic during a storm, instead of
realizing who is riding with us?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Be strong and of good courage, do not fear nor be afraid of them; for
the LORD your God, He is the One who goes with you. He will not leave
you nor forsake you.” (Deuteronomy 31:6 NKJV)</p>
<p>“No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life;
as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not leave you nor
forsake you. (Joshua 1:5 NKJV)</p>
<p>And David said to his son Solomon, “Be strong and of good courage, and
do it; do not fear nor be dismayed, for the LORD God; my God; will be
with you. He will not leave you nor forsake you, until you have
finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD. (1
Chronicles 28:20 NKJV)</p>
<p>Let your conduct be without covetousness; be content with such things
as you have. For He Himself has said, “I will never leave you nor
forsake you.” (Hebrews 13:5 NKJV)</p>
<p>“I am with you always, even to the end of the age (Matthew
28:20 NKJV)”</p>
<p>“Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh. Is there anything too
hard for Me? (Jeremiah 32:27 NKJV)”</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
