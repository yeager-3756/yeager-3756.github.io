  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>What’s this all about? About AD 1900 scientists thought
everything had been figured out, that there was little else to
do. Sure, some details had to be filled in, but for the most
part, we understood the world around us. Then along comes this
Einstein guy and messes up the whole thing! Einstein is famous
for two basic things - Relativity and Quantum Physics - plunging
scientists into a world of doubt and uncertainty. Let’s look at <em>one</em>
of these two (Relativity) and see why it troubles people so. The
other (Quantum Physics) is extremely interesting in it’s own
right, but is a subject for another time (no pun intended!).</p>
<p>First, consider the following diagram (I’ll explain it in a
moment), and remember, <em>there will only be one line of Physics
in the following discussion</em>, so if you are of the type
thinking “I can’t understand physics stuff”, hang on.</p>
<p><img class="centered" src="/images/blog/2009-01-frames-reference_1.gif" width="450" height="330" alt="diagram" /></p>
<p>First, consider you and a friend are riding motorcycles,
represented by A and B. You are traveling from point A to point
A’ at 1/2 the speed of light, or c/2. At point A you shine a
flashlight toward your friend, at point B. (Notice the picture is
not to scale).</p>
<p>Now, from your point of view, <em>neither of you is moving
since your speed is the same</em>. This is familiar to anyone who
has ridden in a car. If someone pulls up alongside you as you are
traveling down the road, if they match your speed, it appears to
both of you as if you are both sitting still in a parking lot. In
either case, both you and your friend see the light travel along
the path noted by d. For you both, <em>your forward motion is
irrelevant to your perception of the event.</em></p>
<p>Now, consider someone standing along side the road, watching
you both go by. Since you and your friend are moving, they see
you travel from A to A’. What path would the light take to them?
Looking at the picture above, the answer is d’. This should also
be familiar to anyone who has ridden in a car. Imagine throwing a
ball out the window of a moving car. Since the car is moving, as
you throw the ball, it still travels forward as it falls, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>Before we continue, be sure you understand the diagram and the
previous two paragraphs. Neither assume any understanding of
relativity or physics, just some recalling of your experiences,
however, they are critical to understand before continuing.</p>
<p>OK, now the fun begins! Once again, we must recall some of our
experiences. Suppose you are traveling in a car at 60mph for 1/2
hour. How far have you traveled? How do you know? The answer is
the following equation: d = v * t . Your distance traveled is
equal to your speed multiplied by the time. Thus 60mph * 1/2 hour
= 30 miles. But you already knew this. (See, you know much more
about physics than you thought!) Perhaps you did not know the
equation, but once again, anyone who has traveled in a car has
experienced this.</p>
<p>Now, lets apply the previous equation to our paths d and d’
above. Then we thus have d = v * t and d’ = v’ * t’. Fair enough?
(Remember, d,v,t are for you and your friend riding the
motorcycles, and d’,v’,t’ are for your friend watching you go
by). Notice by looking at the picture, that d’&gt;d. In the
interest of completeness, I shall now prove to you that d’&gt;d.
For readers who to not wish to proceed in mathematical exactness,
skip the following paragraph.</p>
<div class="green-box">
<p>For all the mathematical details, see the PDF format; a link is available at the end of this article.</p>
</div>
<p>Now, let’s look at all we know:</p>
<ul>
<li>d = v * t</li>
<li>d’ = v’ *t’</li>
<li>d’ &gt; d</li>
</ul>
<p>Combining these equations (using a little algebra) yields the
following inequality v’ * t’ &gt; v * t</p>
<p>OK, I promised only one line of real physics, and here it is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every observer measures the same value c for the speed
of light <cite>Tipler, Physics, Third
Edition Volume 2, page 1107</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, that wasn’t so bad, was it? This was Einstein’s proposal.
Simply put, it just means the speed of light is constant. What
does that mean for our little example? That v’ = v = c. Thus, our
inequality becomes c * t’ &gt; c * t. Once again, using algebra
to simplify yields the following shocking result:</p>
<p>t’ &gt; t</p>
<p>Now, remember what t represents, <em>time</em>. This means for
our observer watching us go by, their time is <em>longer.</em> Does
this mean for our friends on motorcycles they experience a
“slowdown” of time? NO! If we take two atomic clocks
(extremely accurate) and place one on a motorcycle, put the other
with the person standing along the road, synchronize them, then
let the motorcycles ride by, when they come back we notice the
clocks are no longer synchronized! <em>It is the very nature of
time itself that has changed, not the accuracy of the clocks.</em></p>
<p>OK, so you understand a little about relativity - what does this have to
do with the Bible? Consider the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But, beloved, do not forget this one thing, that with the Lord one day
is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day (2 Peter
3:8 NKJV).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is exactly what relativity is all about - time is not absolute, it
can vary depending on mass, acceleration and gravity. Relativity is a
recent discovery (1900’s), so how would Peter have known about it
thousands of years ago? Only by inspiration of the Holy Spirit. The
Bible is the Word of God.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
