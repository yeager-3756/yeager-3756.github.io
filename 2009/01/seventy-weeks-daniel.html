<p>The Famous 70 weeks of Daniel. Even people knowing nothing else of the
book have heard of this passage. It’s vital to understand this section
before you get to Revelation or you’ll be completely lost; Matthew
underscores the importance of the prophecy as it’s specifically called
out for understanding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city,
to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make
reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting
righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint
the most Holy. Know therefore and understand, that from the going
forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the
Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks;
the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous
times. And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off,
but not for himself; and the people of the prince that shall come
shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be
with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.
And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week; and in the
midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to
cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it
desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be
poured upon the desolate. (Daniel 9:24–27)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of
by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, <em><strong>(whoso readeth, let
him understand)</strong></em> (Matt 24:15)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This passage provides the framework to understanding all unfulfilled
prophecy. If you follow this, the remainder falls into place, while
failure to understand this prophecy causes many problems relating the
church and the Jews, the tribulation and the church, and so on.</p>
<p>A few quick remarks to help avoid lots of bad information, and which
should be obvious from even a casual reading (though surprisingly
many miss):</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s about the Jews, <em>not</em> the church. It’s Daniel’s people (the
Jews) and their Holy City (Jerusalem).</li>
<li>It hasn’t happened yet. The end of sin, everlasting righteousness,
and so on. Some attempt to claim a previous fulfillment, but then we
must have missed the end of sin and the beginning of
everlasting righteousness.</li>
<li>The 70 weeks are not continuous. A gap appears between the 69th week
and the 70th week.</li>
<li>Revelation details the 70th week (mainly chapters 6–19).</li>
</ol>
<p>Simply keeping a few obvious things in mind helps avoid pitfalls and
puts you ahead of many scholars who don’t really read the book.</p>
<p>You’ll notice God deals with the church and Jews separately. Before
Jesus, God dealt with the Jews (Gentiles were only included if they
became a Jew). Since Jesus’ death and resurrection, God dealt with the
Gentiles. This leads some to believe God abandoned the Jews, and their
promises are now bestowed on the church.</p>
<p>Nonsense — God’s promises to Abraham in Genesis are unconditional and
irrevocable; the Jewish people still have a destiny to be fulfilled.
Don’t make the mistake the Jews aren’t important anymore, or God’s
promises to them have now fallen on the church. That’s a tragic error,
and the cause of much persecution of the Jewish people. More
importantly, it’s simply not true.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city,
to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make
reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting
righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint
the most Holy. (Daniel 9:24)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As noted, it’s obvious this prophecy concerns the Jews and the city of
Jerusalem, not the Church; the Church and the Jews are distinct and
separate. Second, while history records the fulfillment of parts of the
prophecy, parts are still yet future. Obviously, an end of sin hasn’t
occurred, nor everlasting righteousness.</p>
<p>What are the seventy weeks? The Hebrew says seventy sevens, and it’s
translated weeks. Similar to our use of decade (meaning 10 years), in
this context the Hebrew clearly implies a week means 7 years. One thing
you must note; Bible prophecy uses 360 day years. Why exactly isn’t
important, but if you’re going to try to calculate this yourself you
can’t use the current 365 day calendar.</p>
<p>It does represent a literal period of time — it’s not an allegory and
must be understood to be literal. To jump ahead a bit, several allusions
to the 70th week appear elsewhere in the bible, each describing the time
involved a bit differently, yet equally.</p>
<ul>
<li>42 months — Revelation 11:2,13:5</li>
<li>1,260 days — Revelation 11:3,12:6</li>
<li>Half of one week (literally “sevens”) — Daniel 9:27</li>
<li>Times, time and half a time (3 1/2 years) — Daniel 12:7</li>
</ul>
<p>First, when did this start? Perhaps your Bible mentions 3 possibilities
for this starting event (actually 4).</p>
<ul>
<li>Cyrus in Ezra 1:1–4 (First year of Cyrus)</li>
<li>Darius in Ezra 6:1–12 (First year of Darius)</li>
<li>Artaxerxes in Ezra 7:11–26 (Seventh year Artaxerxes)</li>
<li>Artaxerxes in Nehemiah 2:1–8 (Twentieth year Artaxerxes)</li>
</ul>
<p>So which is it? Go back to the text to get one more clue…</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
