  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Even though Daniel wrote thousands of years ago, his book provides
clarity and relevance for today — a prophetic book you need to
understand. In the middle of Jesus’ private briefing to his disciples on
the end of the age in Matthew 24, Matthew inserts a parenthetical
statement — “Let the reader understand” — you should understand prophecy
for the clarity and understanding it provides current events.</p>
<p>Yet some fear Daniel’s book (and Revelation), viewing end times as
scary, fearful events. Yet they should not be. God gives us knowledge
for a reason — if He didn’t want us to understand, He would not have
revealed it.</p>
<p>On the other side, others devote too much time to prophecy, derailing
other more profitable studies. Every time a war breaks out in the Middle
East “experts” appear starting a debate on whether it’s the beginning of
Armageddon. But who really cares? Yes, we should know and understand
times and events, but not be consumed by them; we don’t know if any
specific event triggers the final week of Daniel’s prophecy, so
understand but don’t obsess.</p>
<p>Daniel’s writing thousands of years ago provides euphemisms still in use
today (even in secular circles):</p>
<ul>
<li>“handwriting on the wall”</li>
<li>“your numbers up”</li>
<li>“idol has clay feet”</li>
<li>“thrown to the lions”</li>
</ul>
<p>Daniel’s prophecy and narratives provide many learning opportunities —
not as stories for entertainment, but events which should change
our actions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For whatever things were written in earlier times were written for our
learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might
have hope. (Romans 15:4)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most importantly, Daniel provides the antidote for one of the biggest
heresies heard today — God no longer involves the Jews in His plan. Some
teach since the Jews didn’t accept their Messiah the promises made to
Abraham transferred to the church; the Church replaced the Jews in Bible
prophecy. Is this scriptural? Does the Bible contain <em>any</em> such
teaching? Never — the promises made in Genesis are unilateral
and irrevocable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth
thee. (Genesis 12:3)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s something we need to understand as we mess around with foreign
policy (and it’s a promise still in effect which should guide how we
handle the Middle East mess). It’s bizarre to imagine, but the creator
of the universe parceled out a tract of land He calls His own, and when
we mess around with Middle East policy we’re poking a finger in the eye
of God — God’s covenant with Abraham in Genesis 15:1–18 is unilateral. …</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
