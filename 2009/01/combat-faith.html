  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>After the events of September 11th everyone eagerly awaited the
President’s state of the union address. Everyone knew the
main topic; most knew the points he would bring up. However, early in
his speech he made the following statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve come to know truths that we will never question: Evil is real,
and it must be opposed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s quite a statement as you think about it, simply because many
people deny evil exists. If you don’t believe me, take
a stroll on almost any college campus and you’ll hear about the basic,
inherent goodness of mankind - every day in every way
we’re getting better and better. (After all, to think we <em>weren’t</em>
getting better would fly in the face of evolution - but that’s a fable
for another time). People believing the inherent goodness
of mankind fill college campuses; it’s the corrupt environment leading
to evil behavior, not some inborn, inherent evil. But
of course that’s not true. Man is basically evil, as anyone who has
been around a two-year old will testify. Do you teach
the two-year old not to share, be selfish or be mean? Nope - it’s
inborn. You must train a child to be good.</p>
<p>Still, some people don’t accept this truth. A friend of mine is a police
officer in a medium city; talking to him convinces
you of one truth: strange things happen on the street. He knows about
the battle between God and satan while most people don’t
see what really goes on. But if you speak to just about any police
officer they can talk to you about many unnatural events
that most people never see (and deny exist) but occur nonetheless.</p>
<p>If you’re not convinced of the inherit evil in mankind, just look at
some recent headlines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lawmakers sanction use of district-approved porn</strong>. Instructions on
homosexual sodomy and a glorified account of lesbian pedophilia are
among the instructional materials approved
by the Los Angeles Unified School District for use in “diversity” and
“safety” programs being presented to elementary through
High School students. (WorldNetDaily, Jan 24, 2002)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dial 9-1-1 for free abortion</strong> Planned Parenthood of New York City
offered women free abortions and other related services as a response
to the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. “Everyone wants to do
something”, spokesperson Ali Bartolone said in a statement.
“This is our response; this is our way of helping women in need”.
(WorldNetDaily Jan 18,2002)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, Mr. President, evil is real and it <em>must</em> be opposed. But how do we
win the battle? We don’t have to guess, John tells us in his
first letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the
victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. (1 John 5:4 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Overcome” is from the root where we get our word “Nike” meaning
victorious or prevail (Zodhiates, The Complete Word Study Dictionary
page 1010). Don’t we want to prevail? Who wouldn’t? You may not think
you’re in a war, but you are in the battle whether you know it
or not. You have two choices: either you’re a combatant or a casualty -
it’s your choice.</p>
<p>But you’re not fighting worldly enemies - you’re fighting an enemy in
multi-dimensional space. Recall 2 Kings Chapter six
as an enemy surrounds Elisha but he doesn’t seem too worried about it.
His servant panicked, waking up Elisha to warn him
of the impending doom. Elisha figured out he wasn’t going to get any
sleep, so he asks the Lord to let the servant in on the
secret. And as if a window opened, the servant sees chariots of fire
all around Elisha.</p>
<p>What did the servant see? For reasons we don’t need to get into here,
the servant saw a window into the multi-dimensional
space we inhabit. We don’t just live in four dimensions, we live in at
least ten. Just because you don’t experience other
dimensions doesn’t mean they don’t exist. But to fight in dimensions
you can’t see you need special weaponry - and Paul gives
us a clue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God
to the pulling down of strong holds; (2 Corinthians 10:4 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Money, power, and prestige are all useless in this war; don’t make the
common mistake you can pick up any weapon and be effective.
For this battle you need special equipment. Best of all, it’s equipment
the Lord Himself wants you to have. So turn to Ephesians
chapter six (the Physics of reality - or how to fight in
multi-dimensional space as I’m sure it’s subtitled in your Bible)
as Paul explains.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against
the wiles of the devil. For we do not wrestle against
flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against
the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual
hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places. Therefore take up the
whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in
the evil day, and having done all, to stand. (Ephesians 6:11-13 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul tells us to put on the whole armor - one or two pieces won’t cut
it. To be effective we need it all. But Paul clearly
states we don’t wrestle against flesh and blood. So many people believe
abortion <em>doctors</em> are the problem - they aren’t (we don’t wrestle
against flesh and blood). Rather, <em>abortion</em> is the problem. Some
misguided people believe they are doing God’s work by the murder of
abortion doctors. But we don’t war
against flesh and blood - these ill-advised people haven’t done their
homework in Ephesians six. Satan is the real enemy,
not people - the doctors themselves are just pawns in
satanic deception.</p>
<p>We don’t just fight, we wrestle - the battle is intimate and personal;
it doesn’t occur in some far-off place, it’s up close.
But more important, these are military terms - to stand. If you think
of an old John Wayne movie where the crusty old sergeant
(John Wayne) tells his motley crew of misfits “Boys, we’ll make our
stand here” (holding off an enemy vastly outnumbering
them) you’ll get the idea.</p>
<p>We won’t go through the entire armor as we want to focus on one piece -
just remember you need it all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to
quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one. (Ephesians 6:16 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The shield of faith has particular importance. Paul uses the
illustration of the Roman soldier, but you must know the Romans
used two different shields. The one Paul refers to is 2 1/2 by 4 feet -
enough to cover the body. In other words, you <em>can hide behind this
shield and be completely protected</em>. Sounds important, huh? But it’s
also the movable part of the armor - you can orientate it in any
direction you need. If
you’ve got a problem in an area of your Christian walk, you can take
cover behind the shield of faith and be protected (This
doesn’t imply you don’t need to shore up those areas that
need attention).</p>
<p>Thus, you see the importance of this piece of armor. If we want to have
victory, we’d better figure out what this faith thing
is. When you think of faith, you might think of the “Hall of faith” in
Hebrews 11, which is good because it’s the same Greek
word in Hebrews 11:1 as in 1 John 5.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things
not seen. (Hebrews 11:1 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Faith “means that persuasion is not the outcome of imagination but is
based on fact, such as the reality of the resurrection
of Christ, and as such it becomes the basis of realistic hope”
(Zodhiates, The Complete Word Study Dictionary page 1162). This is an
important definition. Some people think of Christians and blind faith -
something you wish is true, but don’t
really know if it is true. That’s not the definition the Bible uses.
According to the Bible, you are called to be a skeptic
and check things out. The faith we want is <em>not</em> “blind faith” - it’s a
response to reason and logic.</p>
<p>I frequently get email with a common theme - Christians have blind faith
and anyone who believes in the truth of the Bible
has had their brain removed. Recently, to prove a point I was directed
to a web site that would “open my eyes” and show what
nonsense the Bible is.</p>
<p>This site talked about the miracle of the water turning to wine in John
2, saying the servants fooled the headwaiter into
believing the water really was wine, when in reality it was only water.
The cup (probably made of wood) retained some of the
aroma of the wine; when the servants added some water to the wine left
in the cup the headwaiter couldn’t tell it was really
water. No miracle really happened, the headwaiter was simply tricked.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the assumptions this person makes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Cup was made of wood or clay.</li>
<li>He used the same cup as he had been - the servants didn’t bring him
a small cup of the new wine.</li>
<li>The servants brought only a very small amount of wine to him.</li>
<li>The cup had some old wine left in it.</li>
<li>The headwaiter couldn’t tell water from wine.</li>
</ul>
<p>This guy makes wild assumptions <em>without any evidence</em> to support it
about events occurring thousands of years ago. Why? Because he’s
rejected the possibility of a miracle; he
must make up something no matter how absurd. He’s proposing he knew
exactly what occurred in that room thousands of years
ago, while ignoring the written eyewitness account of what did.</p>
<p>And he says <strong>I</strong> have blind faith?</p>
<p>Faith is not the outcome of imagination but is based on fact (something
you’re going to hear frequently, so get used to it).
So what is Biblical faith? Paul explains in Hebrews.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For by it the elders obtained a good testimony. By faith we understand
that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so
that the things which are seen were not made of things which are
visible. (Hebrews 11:2-3 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a little off topic, but notice the “worlds were framed by the word
of God” - God created the world, not evolution! We
understand this <em>by faith</em> (not the outcome of imagination but based on
fact). Anyone who believes in evolution must <em>prove</em> it using
scientific, experimental evidence. No guesses allowed, we must have
verifiable, experimental evidence. If you can’t
do that, you <em>must</em> admit your theory is unscientific. You can believe
it all you want, just don’t call it science. (By the way, if you have
any experimental evidence for the following I’d love to hear about it -
send it to skeptic@dyeager.org. But you’ll forgive me if I don’t hold my
breath waiting).</p>
<p>The theory of evolution is based on (at least) the following
three ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Matter comes from nothing.</li>
<li>Explosions produce order. (The big bang)</li>
<li>Non-living goo can suddenly come alive.</li>
</ol>
<p>If <em>any one</em> of these three statements is false, evolution falls apart.
Yet all three not only have no experimental evidence for them,
they actually contradict many of the laws we know. They are assumed <em>a
priori</em> because the theory requires them, not because the experimental
evidence says so. And evolutionists say <strong>I</strong> have blind faith?</p>
<p>Evolution is blind faith and is by definition unscientific - it is <em>not</em>
based on fact, <em>not</em> based on experiments, thus <em>not</em> based on science
(<strong>by definition</strong>). Evolution is dead - get over it. It’s just not a
valid scientific theory. Even if I was an atheist, I would have to
reject
evolution - it just doesn’t have any experimental evidence supporting
it. I’ve yet to see any experiments done to prove non-life
can suddenly become alive, or that matter can spontaneously appear. But
we’ll move on.</p>
<p>In contrast we are called <em>not</em> to have blind faith - check things out
for yourself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These were more fair-minded than those in Thessalonica, in that they
received the word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures
daily to find out whether these things were
so. (Acts 17:11 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Test all things; hold fast what is good. (1 Thessalonians 5:21 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, Mr. President, we are at war with evil and we need faith to
overcome - we need combat faith to give us victory - blind
faith won’t cut it. But combat faith is an interesting thing; we learn
much about it in Hebrews.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to
God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder
of those who diligently seek Him. (Hebrews 11:6 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow. It’s <em>impossible</em> to please God without combat faith. It doesn’t
say it’s hard to please Him without faith or God would like us to have
faith,
but faith is <em>required</em>. It’s a prerequisite. And what is combat faith?
It’s not the outcome of imagination but based on fact. So let’s look at
a few facts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had
received the promises offered up his only begotten
son, of whom it was said, “In Isaac your seed shall be called,”
concluding that God was able to raise him up, even from the
dead, from which he also received him in a figurative sense. (Hebrews
11:17-19 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is covered in Genesis chapter 22; you should read the story for
yourself. God orders Abraham to offer his only son as
a sacrifice to Him. Abraham begins to follow orders, but at the last
moment an angel stops him. Abraham didn’t figure he had a problem, God
did - for God promised Abraham his son Isaac would be his heir. Thus, if
Isaac
is killed God would have to resurrect him. (Note, God is NOT advocating
child sacrifice - This story is a model of Jesus
Christ and His resurrection. Paul even mentions in Hebrews Abraham
received Isaac back in a figurative sense. The whole story
in Genesis 22 is a model God provided several thousand years before
Jesus’ birth).</p>
<p>Faith - not the outcome of imagination but based on fact. Abraham had
previous experiences and based his belief on those previous
facts. He didn’t walk off a pier and hope for the best. No, when the
Bible speaks of faith it means not the outcome of imagination,
but based on facts. Abraham based his faith on facts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were encircled for
seven days. (Hebrews 11:30 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’d like to see the meeting where Joshua meets with his generals to
discuss the battle plan. This is the most bizarre battle
plan ever produced - it took faith (not the outcome of imagination but
based on fact) to execute it. But again, it was Joshua’s
previous experiences that led him to execute this plan with confidence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And what more shall I say? For the time would fail me to tell of
Gideon and Barak and Samson and Jephthah, also of David and
Samuel and the prophets: who through faith subdued kingdoms, worked
righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of
lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword,
out of weakness were made strong, became valiant in battle,
turned to flight the armies of the aliens. (Hebrews 11:32-34 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the question is, how do we get this? The apostles asked this specific
question to the Lord, and His response was in Luke 17.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So the Lord said, “If you have faith as a mustard seed, you can say to
this mulberry tree, ’Be pulled up by the roots and
be planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you”. (Luke 17:6 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our faith must not be very good - we are soft. I don’t know how much
faith a mustard seed has, but apparently it’s more than
I. Many people don’t see miracles very often, yet I wonder if it’s due
to our lack of faith. As I talk to the people sent
out on mission trips I frequently see where prayer (in faith) yields
mighty results, so I do know God answers prayer on a
regular basis.</p>
<p>This sounds good - who wouldn’t like to have the mountains moved in
their lives? All we have to do is have the faith of a
mustard seed? But keep reading - Jesus doesn’t end there. We are just
soldiers in the army of God; we must understand our
role, as Jesus continues.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“And which of you, having a servant plowing or tending sheep, will say
to him when he has come in from the field, ’Come at
once and sit down to eat’? But will he not rather say to him,
’Prepare something for my supper, and gird yourself and serve
me till I have eaten and drunk, and afterward you will eat and
drink’? Does he thank that servant because he did the things
that were commanded him? I think not. So likewise you, when you have
done all those things which you are commanded, say, ’We
are unprofitable servants. We have done what was our duty to
do.’”(Luke 17:7-10 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can’t think of ourselves more highly than we should - God gives us
everything and we are only doing our duty. We do have
a self-esteem problem in this country - we have <em>way</em> too much!
Everything I have, every talent I have is a gift from God.</p>
<p>For example, one of my talents deals with computers and such. At the
company I work for, I designed the entire network linking
150 computers over 4 different sites on opposite sides of the country.
As I was walking though the plant one day I started
thinking about the fiber optics running overhead, how I designed the
whole thing, and how it just plain works (which can be
unusual in this field). Suddenly, the thought crossed my mind - “is
this not a great empire I have built?” (in my best Nebuchadnezzar
voice). (If this isn’t familiar to you, read Daniel chapter four - it
didn’t work out to well for Nebuchadnezzar)</p>
<p>Why would I think such things? Because I think of myself more highly
than I should - I’ve got a self-esteem problem. I’m only
doing what the Lord has blessed me with. In short, I’m an unprofitable
servant only doing what my duty is to do. Paul summarizes
this perspective to Timothy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No one engaged in warfare entangles himself with the affairs of this
life, that he may please him who enlisted him as a soldier.
(2 Timothy 2:4 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pride easily creeps in when we use the talents the Lord has blessed us
with. This is perhaps one of satan’s favorite tricks - to give you a
self-esteem problem. It’s a problem you must continually deal with. The
world continually
bombards us with messages like “you deserve a break today”; if you’re
not careful you might buy into that foolishness. We’ve
got to maintain perspective of our position, our duty, and our
relationship to God.</p>
<p>We are in a war and we need faith to overcome. How do we get it?
Sometimes by trials - it’s when we see how God got us through
an ugly spot. That’s what Hebrews chapter 11 is all about - notice how
God pulled all these people through during a crisis.
As you continually see and experience how God provides, your faith
continues to build. Soon, you get a complete trust in the
Lord like Job:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though He slay me, yet will I trust Him. (Job 13:15 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Job had faith no matter what happened. We need that also. Faith is not
something you have when things are going well; it’s
not the outcome of imagination but based on fact.</p>
<p>When you’re in crisis, when the enemy says, “Has God really said” and
tempts you to doubt the Word of God just like he did
with Adam and Eve in the garden, when your back’s against the wall,
when you’re in the soup, <em>it’s too late to get the shield</em>. You need to
get the shield <strong>before</strong> the battle.</p>
<p>So here’s our action plan.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of
witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which
so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is
set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher
of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the
cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right
hand of the throne of God. For consider Him who endured such
hostility from sinners against Himself, lest you become weary
and discouraged in your souls. (Hebrews 12:1-3 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Step one - don’t become discouraged. Don’t believe the lies of the
enemy. Base your faith on the fact of the Word of God.
Remember your previous experiences and how God pulled you through.</p>
<p>Step two - get a battle plan - and here’s ours.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore we must give the more earnest heed to the things we have
heard, lest we drift away. (Hebrews 2:1 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We must stay focused on the Lord, continue to develop our faith and
trust and not become complacent, lest we drift away. That’s
what combat faith is all about, and that’s what we need to develop.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
