<blockquote>
<p>My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials,
knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. (James 1:2-3 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve come to the conclusion James is a
nutcase. His ship is not firmly tied to the pier. His bread is
not cooked in the middle. His six-pack is missing the little plastic
thingy. Joy in trials? Ha! What a psycho. This one verse is enough to
write off this Jesus thing and Christians in general. They must be a
crazy mixed-up group of people to believe this junk.</p>
<p>But wait — if the Bible is the Word of God there must be a point to
this. Joy in trials? Yeah right. Yet that’s exactly what God wants us to
do, as He explains through James (the brother of Jesus). If we don’t
understand, we must remember two things: first, if a passage sounds
weird, it’s because we need to dig into it a little more — and second,
God doesn’t work like the world does — God’s wisdom is frequently the
opposite of the world’s wisdom.</p>
<p>So we need to peel this onion and see what’s inside before we dismiss
James, and by association, Jesus.</p>
<p>A simple answer is usually given in response to this verse — during
trials we tend to pray more, and lean more on God instead of ourselves.
How many of us have found that out? How many trials did it take to learn
that lesson? It’s a critical lesson we must learn, and God is willing to
do whatever it takes for us to learn it. You see, we inherited a genetic
defect from Adam — the knowledge of good and evil. When Adam took of the
forbidden fruit in the garden of Eden, we (being his descendants)
inherited his curse. Before Adam ate, he was innocent — he had no
knowledge of good and evil. After, he did.</p>
<p>Well duh, you say, that’s obvious. Sure it is — but the implication
isn’t always obvious. Since we know good from evil, we frequently don’t
rely on God. It’s easy to fall into the trap that we can handle a
situation, in fact, we don’t even need to bother God with this petty
matter, we’ll just handle it ourselves. And then wammo — we stumble and
fall. Why? The knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>So God allows trials to come so we might draw nearer to Him. But how
does this work practically? I understand the <em>theory</em>, but it’s the
<em>application</em> I have trouble with. That’s the real lesson here, and as
Paul Harvey would say, <em>that’s the rest of the story.</em> As an example,
look to the apostle Paul. Paul probably experienced more problems in
life than most of us.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the Jews five times I received forty stripes minus one. Three
times I was beaten with rods; once I was stoned; three times I was
shipwrecked; a night and a day I have been in the deep; in journeys
often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils of my own
countrymen, in perils of the Gentiles, in perils in the city, in
perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false
brethren; in weariness and toil, in sleeplessness often, in hunger and
thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness; besides the other
things, what comes upon me daily: my deep concern for all the
churches. (2 Corinthians 11:24-28 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow. A few notes are in order. “forty stripes” is a beating with a whip.
Stoned doesn’t refer to drugs but literally having stones thrown at him
(and they drug him out of the city and hoped they killed him — Acts
14:19). He’d been in jail so many times he must have been on a first
name basis with many of the guards. And if you traveled by ship in those
days, be sure Paul wasn’t onboard — every ship he got on went down! Paul
must have been the inspiration for the song with the words “nobody knows
the trouble I’ve seen — nobody knows the sorrow”. And make no mistake
about it, Paul definitely experienced sorrow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For we do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, of our trouble which
came to us in Asia: that we were burdened beyond measure, above
strength, so that we despaired even of life. (2 Corinthians 1:8 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can imagine with Paul’s problems, despairing of life would be easy.
But how about you? What are you despairing about — even of life? Have
you experienced some of what Paul did? Jail? Shipwrecks? Or how about a
more modern slant — broke? Destitute? How do we deal with such things?
Paul has the answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication,
with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the
peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your
hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. (Philippians 4:6-7 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In spite of all Paul’s problems, he talks of the peace of God. But it’s
the following clause that holds the lesson for us — “which surpasses all
understanding”. You see, if you’re looking for peace <em>from</em>
understanding in your trials I can already give you the answer — there
won’t be any; many times we just don’t understand what’s going on. Yet
Jesus can give you the peace that <em>passes</em> understanding.</p>
<p>Paul was an intense man. Later in the letter to the Philippians he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not that I speak in regard to need, for I have learned in whatever
state I am, to be content: (Philippians 4:11 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not regard to need? When he writes this, Paul is in a dungeon — complete
with rats, moldy bread and raw sewage. Maybe you’re in jail right now —
perhaps it’s a physical one, but perhaps it’s mental — you just can’t
break out of the doom and despair in your life. Stay with us, Paul shows
us the secret, and provides a “get out of jail free” card (After all,
Jesus has already paid the debt we can’t pay).</p>
<p>By the way, Paul was chained to a guard during his stay in prison. What
do you suppose Paul thought of his chains? Did he view them as a means
to prevent him from escaping? NO! When presented with the chance to
escape, he didn’t (Acts 16:26-28). Paul probably thought the chains were
so the <em>soldier</em> couldn’t get away from <em>Paul!</em> Could you imagine being
chained to this fanatical, zealous apostle for a shift? Many of them got
saved (Phil 1:12-13).</p>
<p>Paul’s lesson is simple: be content with where you are, and trust in the
Lord, as Proverbs says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trust in the LORD with all your heart, And lean not on your own
understanding; (Proverbs 3:5 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right, you say. Just who is this LORD that I can trust Him? What if He
treats us like puppets in His sadistic game? Good question — one
deserving of an answer. What does God have to say about his nature?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the LORD,
thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope.
(Jeremiah 29:11 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What hope, you may say. I don’t have any hope at all. I’m stuck in these
four walls; my mind is distressed and tormented. How can you talk of
hope? You’re crazier than James! But for the child of God, there is
<em>always</em> hope.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God
and Savior Jesus Christ, (Titus 2:13 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What hope do we have? Looking for the appearing of our savior Jesus. Of
course, if you’re not a Christian you might be right, there isn’t a lot
of hope. But maybe God has gone through great lengths to speak to you.
Maybe God is calling you back. Maybe He just wants you to know Him
better. Or maybe during these events you share your faith with someone
who desperately needs it. I don’t know. But one thing I do know that
Paul tells me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And we know that all things work together for good to those who love
God, to those who are the called according to His purpose. (Romans
8:28 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn’t say we understand all things, just that all things work
together for good. But not for everyone, only for those who love God and
are the called according to His purpose. We are called for <em>His</em>
purpose, not ours. We are His workmanship, created for good works
(Ephesians 2:10). Paul knew this — that’s why he was content in whatever
state he found himself — shipwrecked, in prison, beaten, and finally
executed. But if you’re not a Christian this wonderful promise doesn’t
apply to you.</p>
<p>So what do we do about trials? Easy. Don’t look for understanding — it
won’t come. You can go to all the therapy you want, but you won’t get
understanding — only large debts. But you do have available the peace of
God which passes understanding.</p>
<p>And looking at the life of Paul a final conclusion is drawn: be sold out
for Jesus, and don’t worry about anything else. Run the race
with endurance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But none of these things move me; nor do I count my life dear to
myself, so that I may finish my race with joy, and the ministry which
I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace
of God. (Acts 20:24 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives
the prize? Run in such a way that you may obtain it. (1 Corinthians
9:24 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of
witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily
ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before
us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for
the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the
shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
(Hebrews 12:1-2 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul knew what the priority was: be sold out to Jesus. Whatever came his
way didn’t distract him from the goal, so that he could say just before
that Roman sword flashed in the sun to chop off his head:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept
the faith. (2 Timothy 4:7 NKJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trials come; be sold out to Jesus — don’t look for understanding, look
to Jesus for peace that passes understanding.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
