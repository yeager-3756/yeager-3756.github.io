  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>One of the arguments skeptics like to disprove is C.S. Lewis’ logical
conclusion from the claims of Jesus. Commonly called “The Trilemma” or
“Lord liar or lunatic” (although Lewis didn’t use exactly those
words),
although one wonders why it becomes so important to discredit a
philosophical argument having little bearing on the facts involving
the
diety of Jesus.</p>
<p>But enough speculation, allow Lewis himself to explain.</p>
<blockquote><p>I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish
thing that people often say about Him: “I’m ready to accept Jesus as a
great moral teacher, but I don’t accept His claim to be God.” That is the
one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of
things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a
lunatic—on a level with the man who says he is a poached egg—or else he
would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was,
and is, the Son of God: or else a madman or something worse. You can shut
Him up for a fool, you can spit at Him and kill Him as a demon; or you can
fall at His feet and call Him Lord and God. But let us not come with any
patronizing nonsense about His being a great human teacher. He has not left
that open to us. He did not intend to. (C.S. Lewis “Mere Christianity” tenth printing 1969 Macmillan Company page 55-56)</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s Lewis’ original argument appearing in his book. Some people add
or modify it, but we’re going to use Lewis’ original text (it’s only
fair, after all it’s his idea). What could logically be wrong with such an
argument? What problems do the skeptic point out? I’m going to use
<em>one</em> article refuting Lewis’ discussion (appearing on
<a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/jim_perry/trilemma.html">infidels.org</a>
by Jim Perry). His is certainly not the only one, but I believe it summarizes common
objections (all the following quotations being from his article). The first
problem with Lewis’ argument Mr. Perry notes, is he doesn’t agree Jesus ever
claimed to be diety.</p>
<blockquote><p>First, it relies for impact on a premise which is is both
ambiguous and controversial, which is the question of just what “Jesus’
claims” were … Exactly what Jesus claimed is not known. The gospels are
the closest thing we have to an account of his claims, and there is no
explicit claim of divinity by Jesus in the gospels, let alone an
unambiguous theological statement of what precisely it might mean for a man
to claim to be God.</p></blockquote>
<p>So the question is, did Jesus claim to be God? If Jesus didn’t claim to
be God, Lewis’ argument is rendered moot and you need read no further.
Jesus is then just a man or any of the other thousands of spiritual
leaders (who never claim to be God) walking the earth since the beginning of
time. Since it’s Jesus’ claim to diety unique to Him, it’s <em>critical</em> to
understand the claims of Jesus. Is Jesus’ claim ambiguous?</p>
<p>In John’s Gospel Jesus states “I and my Father are one” (John 10:30
KJV). That may appear an ambiguous statement, but the Pharisiees
certainly understood the meaning; they immediately pick up stones to stone Him.
A capital crime deserves an explanation, and Jesus asks for one; in verse
33 the Pharisiees answer “because that thou, being a man, makest thyself
God”. The Pharisiees were no friends of Jesus, yet they understood what
He <em>claimed</em> to be. They rejected it of course, but understood the
claim nonetheless. Jesus said He was God in the flesh.</p>
<p>In another encounter earlier in John 8, Jesus says “Verily, verily, I
say unto you, Before Abraham was, I AM”. Again, they pick up stones to
kill Him. Why? If you recall back in Exodus 3 as God called Moses he
wanted to know who to tell the people sent him. God replies “I AM THAT I AM …
Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me
unto you.” In John 8 the Pharisiees understand Jesus claims to be the voice
of the burning bush — God Himself (another capital offense). Neither
situation in John was ambiguous for the Pharisiees. As they did not
believe Jesus to be God, they rightfully wanted to execute Him for blasphemy.</p>
<p>Finally, in Luke 19 (what we call Palm Sunday), as Jesus rides in to
Jerusalem the crowd begins to sing one of the Psalms. Something you
might miss (but the Pharisiees didn’t) is this Psalm speaks of the Jewish
Messiah. Certainly Jesus doesn’t want the people misled to believe He
is the Messiah they wait for does He? Jesus responds “I tell you that, if
these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.”.
He doesn’t say the crowd is in error or incorrect in applying a messianic
psalm to Him, but affirms the correct interpretation.</p>
<p>These three events (among others) establish a lack of ambiguity in the
people listening to Jesus and interacting with Him, clearly
understanding His claim to divinity. They rejected it, and eventually devised a
scheme to kill Him, but for all the problems with the Pharisees they at least
understood what Jesus <em>claimed</em> to be. So Jesus’ claim to be God is
established and unambiguous (although just as controversial today as
in 30AD) — what other problems does Lewis’ argument hold for Mr. Perry?</p>
<blockquote><p>Second, it makes unwarranted extrapolations from the general
idea of saying something known not to be literally true to the worst sort
of malicious lying, and from believing something which is not true to
raving lunacy. … Addressing this argument requires some degree of
caution: the basic criticism lies in the fact that none of the three horns
of the “trilemma” actually represent a single possibility, but rather a
broad spectrum of possibilities. … the extremes of “lunatic” or
“fiend” are not justified as the sole alternatives. In particular, it is
still quite possible to consider Jesus a sound moral teacher even if one
doesn’t accept the claim of divinity.</p></blockquote>
<p>The idea of three possibilities (Lord, liar or lunatic) are deduced
from the boolean logic arising from Lewis’ argument. Simply put, Jesus
either told the truth or not (pick one). If He spoke falsely, He either knew
he spoke falsely or didn’t (pick one). Lewis provides three possibilities
from the simple outcome of analyzing the statement.</p>
<ol>
<li>Jesus spoke the truth. If so, He must be acknowledged as God.</li>
<li>Jesus spoke falsely, but didn’t know it was false.</li>
<li>Jesus spoke falsely, and knew it to be false.</li>
</ol>
<p>If Jesus spoke falsely, but didn’t know, I’ll call that whole realm
“lunatic”. It could be delusion, mental illness, drug-induced or a
host of other possibilities. However, they all boil down to one
conclusion — He didn’t know what He said was untrue. In that case, we
can attribute His claims to sincere desire, but some error He was
unaware of. Jesus was sincere, but sincerely wrong. He believed He was the path
to salvation, but was unaware His statements were wrong. Naturally, if He
taught falsely He’s not a good teacher under any reasonable
interpretation of those words, no matter how sincere He was.</p>
<p>If Jesus spoke falsely, but did know, I’ll call that whole realm
“liar”. For some reason, Jesus was aware of His untrue statements, but
didn’t care. Lewis says this makes Jesus the “Devil of Hell”; for some
reason He deliberately misled people. If someone claims to be the way
to heaven and eternal happiness, yet knows what they say is false, what
else can you say about them? They’re deliberately deceiving you for some
reason. Perhaps they want to hide the true path so you won’t find it, or maybe
just try to give you a hope of something that doesn’t really exist. The
motive  is irrelevant — the fact remains He’s a liar and deceiver. The
skeptic raises a possibility for Jesus knowing He lied, but as we have
established, motive is irrelevant to the discussion.</p>
<blockquote><p>Another, separate, possibility is that of the “noble lie”.
Jesus may have felt that his teachings on behavior were so important as to
validate falsely claiming special authority from (or at an extreme, as) God
in order to persuade people to follow them.</p></blockquote>
<p>A good teacher won’t lie or attempt to trick you to believe his
teaching. If Jesus claimed to be God (as previously shown), would a
good teacher deliberately deceive you when dealing with such an important
issue as eternal life? I don’t think so. This possibility is inconsistent
with any spiritual instruction — if you need to be tricked into believing
it, is it really moral? Do we really want to follow a God who tricks
us into believing Him? I don’t think so, and this argument is completely
without merit. In any event, if Jesus lied, He lied. Motive is
irrelevant, although interesting to speculate on.</p>
<p>One thing I will agree is a “broad spectrum of possibilities” exist.
Certainly we’re not reduced to the specifics of lunatic or liar. As
already  mentioned, many possibilities exist for His motives if He lied.
Interesting  debate, but not relevant to Lewis’ discussion, and certainly doesn’t
eliminate the need to choose one of three possibilities. The “broad
spectrum” simply represent categories of either not knowing you speak
falsely or knowing you speak falsely. Only three possibilities exist.
Lewis’ argument is perfect, as even the article hints at.</p>
<blockquote><p>If, when Jesus made his claims, they were false but he believed
them to be true, was he insane? If, as we have stipulated in this section,
his claims include being God in some sense, then this would probably be
considered a delusion. To what degree it was pathological would depend on
just exactly what he understood by “being God”. If he understood
something akin to what is believed by the Christian faith, then it would be
a quite major delusion. If he believed he was the prophesied Messiah as
expected by the Jews of his time, then he might have been honestly mistaken.</p></blockquote>
<p>To sum up the argument is the following.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As has been shown above, it is not the case that there are
three and only three precisely-defined choices to be made here, but
rather a vast continuum of possibilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Correct. More than three narrow possibilities exist but unfortunately
the vast continuum of possibilities all boil down to one of three
general categories: Lord, liar or lunatic. Many shades exist in the last two
choices, but either Jesus knew He spoke untruth, or He didn’t. If He
wasn’t God you’re left with trying to deduce <em>why</em> he lied or why he didn’t
<em>know</em> He lied, but that doesn’t avoid the fact He told
untruths — and as such can’t be a good moral teacher. Thus, you still
only have three choices. As Lewis states, you must choose.</p>
<p>You don’t have to accept Jesus as Lord and He won’t make you. You are a
free agent able to choose Jesus as God or not. However, you <em>must</em>
make a choice. The popular idea of Jesus as a good teacher but not God
is illogical and inconsistent. From simple logical analysis, who is
Jesus? Lord? Liar? or Lunatic?</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
