  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Sadly today logic is no longer taught in our <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/01/failure-public-education.html">failed government schools</a>,
which turn out millions of people who can’t analyze an argument
logically. This leads to <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/07/political-correctness-contradictions.html">absurd contradictions</a>
like
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/03/avoiding-logical-error-there-no-god.html">atheism</a>
or other <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/04/atheists-say-funniest-things.html">funny-but-sad ideas</a>.</p>
<p>Many of these errors are quickly spotted, and easily avoided. Let’s
tackle some common mistakes and you’ll catch on quickly — and be
surprised how often these occur in political, science, and
other discussions.</p>
<h2>1. Red Herring</h2>
<p>An attempt to divert attention away from a poorly supported position.
The term comes from dogs chasing after a scent; if you drag a stinky old
fish across the path, the dogs lose the trail.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/06/more-dawkins-morality-no-absolutes.html">Richard Dawkins was asked about morality</a>
and how he determined it, he responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The absolute morality that the religious person might profess would
include what, stoning people for adultery, death for apostasy,
punishment for breaking the Sabbath; these are all things which are
religiously based absolute moralities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s a Red Herring — an attempt to divert attention away from the main
point (where does atheism get its morality) to another argument
(religion’s morality is absurd).</p>
<p>Another example came when we pointed out the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/01/atheism.html">illogic of atheism</a>, someone replied
“Atheism is illogical but theism isn’t?”.</p>
<p>Both those replies fail to deal with the issue at hand, attempting to
drag a stinky old fish (Red Herring) across the path and divert
attention away from their failure to address the issue.</p>
<h2>2. Argument from Authority</h2>
<p>An argument <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/02/logical-errors-argument-authority.html">appealing to someone holding “expert”</a>
status — meaning their ideas should be automatically accepted. The
problem occurs when many of these “experts” turn out later to be wrong —
see flat earth, Piltdown man, and so on.</p>
<p>Just because someone has a PhD or “credentials” does <em>not</em> mean they’re
right. Their argument should stand or fail on its merits, not
their name.</p>
<p>Even <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2008/04/probability-evolution.html">university professors</a>
make mistakes — if you blindly follow them because they’re
“authoritative”, you’ll also be victim to their errors.</p>
<h2>3. Argument from Majority</h2>
<p>You’ve heard this many times — the majority of scientists hold position
“X”, thus it must be right. <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/12/problem-morality-where-does-it-come.html">Right and wrong is never found by polling</a>
or popular opinion; truth doesn’t change just because everyone
thinks so.</p>
<p>You’ll find this mistake made by global warming proponents, with claims
like “the majority of scientists believe in man-made global warming” —
it matters not a whit if they <em>all</em> believe it, it matters if it’s
<em>true</em>.</p>
<p>Naturally, you can combine this and the previous argument from authority
error, as in a famous Camel cigarette ad of long ago…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a recent survey, we asked “What cigarette do you smoke, Doctor” …
and the brand named most was Camel. Yes, according to a nationwide
survey, more doctors smoked Camels, than any other cigarette.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow, with wonderful arguments like that, it makes <em>me</em> want to run out
and buy a pack of … oh nevermind.</p>
<h2>4. Argument from Repetition</h2>
<p>Some believe if you repeat a mistake long enough it becomes true. Not
so, but you <em>will</em> find a repeated error causes many people to accept it
— especially if combined with errors one and two above.</p>
<p>For example, how often have you heard of the government “surplus” in the
late 90’s? One problem, <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/06/truth-lie-myth-surplus.html">no surplus existed</a>
— a fact easily verified from the governments own reports — or the even
falser <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/06/truth-lie-stimulus-jobs-saved-or-created.html">myth the stimulus created jobs</a>
(also note in the comments of an <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/04/increasing-federal-deficit.html">article on the debt</a>
some people simply can’t accept the truth when it’s right in from of
them, due to falling victim to repetition, argument from authority, and
argument from majority errors. A real failure of critical thinking).</p>
<p>It matters not how often the lie repeats, it’s still a lie.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this tactic usually works. Consider how many people
actually believe the myth of the surplus, or the stimulus created jobs
(note: those may be Democrat lies and deceit, but most politicians of
any party use similar tricks, and you’ll see people of all political
positions repeat these false statements).</p>
<h2>5. Cliched Thinking / Group-Think / Personal Attacks</h2>
<p>Slogan thinking and protester mentality — reducing entire discussions
down to something fitting on a sign.</p>
<p>For multiple examples, read a <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110712155611AAwKz7U">thread on skepticism</a>
(actually rebuttals to our “Skeptic Series”) and notice the replies
along the lines of “he’s an idiot”, “no proof”, etc. That’s an Ad
hominem (Latin for “to the man”) attack, commonly known as attacking the
person instead of the argument.</p>
<p>Many of those replies are canned group-think, or simply personal attacks
— none of which actually <em>rebut</em> the original article. Epic failure, but
funny to read.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>In the recent downgrade of the US credit rating, politicians did what
politicians do — blame everyone else for <em>their</em> mistakes. Have you
heard something like this on the news recently?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All (argument from majority) serious economists (argument from
authority) agree we must follow policy “X”. These extremists on the
other side (Ad hominem) refuse to follow what economists agree on. We
need to focus on investment and what kind of country we want to live
in (Red Herring).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then notice how each political party “stays on message” (argument from
repetition). Is it any wonder Washington is broken when the people
making decisions on the future of the country can’t even
think logically?</p>
<h2>Conclusion and Homework</h2>
<p>One thing all logical errors share — they don’t add <em>anything</em> to the
discussion. Anyone with a background in logic immediately notices these
mistakes, and can point out you’re not really addressing the idea.
Sadly, logic and debate isn’t taught much anymore, and the longer we go
without training, the more people can be fooled by these easily
spotted errors.</p>
<p>For your homework, watch some political, religious, or just about any
other discussion on the Internet, news, or other media, and see how
frequently you see these five errors pop up. For bonus points, see if
you can get all five in one comment or interview — sometimes even
one sentence!</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
