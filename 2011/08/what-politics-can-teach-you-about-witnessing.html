  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Politics will always be a rough-and-tumble business with heated debates
and strong emotions. However, if you’re going to engage in political
discussion (and you <em>should</em> as a steward of the country), you must be
prepared to take advantage of any situation which presents itself.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of an <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/unforced+error">unforced error</a>, as a Tea
Party person received some one-on-one time with the President.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/08/15/obama-conversation-with-tea-partier-gets-heated/">
<p>President Obama got into a heated back-and-forth Monday with a Tea Party activist who demanded to know at the end of a town hall meeting here whether Vice President Biden had called Tea Partiers “terrorists” during the debt ceiling debate on Capitol&nbsp;Hill.</p>
<p>Obama did say he would discuss the matter further with Rhodes, founder of the Iowa Tea Party, after the event. And the duo was spotted in an animated conversation a few moments&nbsp;later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s <strong>suppose you got some time with the President — is this the
<em>single</em> issue</strong> you’d bring up? The most important? We hope not. Not
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/04/increasing-federal-deficit.html">Trillions in new debt</a>,
or your own <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/07/6-steps-solve-federal-deficit.html">6 steps to solve the debt</a>,
or the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/12/another-obamacare-ruling-abused-commerce-clause.html">abused commerce clause</a>,
or even the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/06/truth-lie-myth-surplus.html">myth of the surplus</a>
— the biggest pressing issue is an alleged comment by the VP? Seriously?</p>
<p>In tennis you’d call this an unforced error — opportunity wasted.</p>
<h2>The Political Side</h2>
<p>Politics is serious stuff, and <strong>if the Tea Party wants to play with the
big boys, it’s time to grow up</strong>, and rule number one is: when you get
time with the President, be prepared and get to the <em>big</em> issues.</p>
<p>What did anyone expect the President to say: “Yes he said it, and I
agree, so tough on you”. Really? When backed into a corner, a politician
reverts to his nature: deny, deflect, and
<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/obfuscate">obfuscate</a> (confuse).</p>
<p><strong>If you’re going to play big-boy games, you’d better bring your “A”
game</strong>. That means be prepared, <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/08/do-you-make-these-5-mistakes-conversation.html">avoid logical errors</a>,
learn <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/category/logic.html">how to discuss and debate</a>,
and be polite and civil.</p>
<h2>The Practical Side — Lessons to Learn</h2>
<p><strong>Be prepared to take advantage of every available opportunity</strong> — thus
you must be <em>prepared</em> for opportunities when they present themselves,
or as has been said “The harder I practice, the luckier I get” (quote
attributed to many people) and be <em>bold</em> when doors open — don’t make
unforced errors by wasting opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Preparedness takes work, so bring your lunch-box</strong> and hard-hat, roll
up your selves, and get ready, as Paul reminds us in the armor of God to
“gird your loins”, which means <em>be prepared for action and movement</em>.
It’s time to step up to the majors. You can do it.</p>
<h2>Ready to Get Started?</h2>
<p>Walter Martin spoke on “The Baptism of Boldness”. For those who can’t
watch the video, here’s a small excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re suffering from an endemic disease. This disease in the Christian
world is known by its Latin name, non-rock-a-boatus. What it really
means is, “Whatever you do, don’t rock the boat.” The cure for this
disease is a baptism of boldness.</p>
<p>… You may be thinking, “You seem pretty uptight about this, Dr.
Martin.” And I am, because we need to get rid of this
non-rock-a-boatus mentality that is so prevalent in this country. The
apostle Paul in 2 Timothy 4:2 doesn’t hesitate to talk about the
things that concern him. He says, “I charge you therefore before God
and the Lord Jesus Christ who will judge the living and the dead and
is appearing in his kingdom, preach the word; be ready in season and
out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with great patience
and instruction.”</p>
<p>Do you know there are Christians running around today waiting for a
convenient moment to “preach the word” that never comes? And the
reason it never comes is because <strong>God doesn’t care about convenience;
God cares about obedience</strong>. So you preach the Word, whether it’s
convenient or inconvenient, “in season” or “out of season.”</p>
</blockquote>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
