<p>The ESV pops on the scene as one of the new, hot, translations. But how
does it stack up?</p>

<h2>1. Translator Methods</h2>
<p>The ESV begins with the RSV, as the translators say “the 1971 RSV text
providing the starting point for our work”. If you’re familiar with the
RSV, that statement alone speaks volumes.</p>
<p>Which Greek text forms its foundation? Does it use the text edited by
Westcott and Hort? Again, the translators say “The ESV is based on the
Masoretic text of the Hebrew Bible as found in Biblia Hebraica
Stuttgartensia (2nd ed., 1983), and on the Greek text in the 1993
editions of the Greek New Testament (4th corrected ed.), published by
the United Bible Societies (UBS), and Novum Testamentum Graece (27th
ed.), edited by Nestle and Aland”.</p>
<p>As we’ve noted in our <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/01/which-bible-translation-best.html">Primer on Bible Translation</a>,
Nestle-Aland and UBS are different names for what remains essentially
Westcott and Hort’s controversial work.</p>
<p>Thus, the ESV’s origins are the old RSV, and the Alexandrian
(Westcott/Hort) Greek text (if you want a review of the differences in
the Alexandrian text, read the previously linked primer on
Bible translation).</p>
<h2>2. Missing Verses</h2>
<p>It surprises many people when they find out verses have been deleted
from their Bible. Does the ESV follow Westcott and Hort’s lead? Some
translations — even based on the corrupt Alexandrian Westcott-Hort text
— don’t follow as much as others (NASB is one example which refuses to
delete all the verses Westcott and Hort did).</p>
<p>Let’s see how the ESV stacks up.</p>
<ul>
<li>(Matthew 18:11 NKJV) For the Son of Man has come to save that which
was lost.</li>
<li>(Matthew 18:11 ESV) <strong>deleted</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Notice the ESV jumps straight from v10 to v12. Did you know they omitted
verse 11?</p>
<ul>
<li>(Revelation 11:17 NKJV) saying: We give You thanks, O Lord God
Almighty, The One who is and who was and who is to come, Because You
have taken Your great power and reigned.</li>
<li>(Revelation 11:17 ESV) saying: “We give thanks to you, Lord God
Almighty, who is and who was <del>and who is to come</del>, for you have
taken your great power and begun to reign.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whoops. They omitted the “who is to come” part. Those two edits can be
debated back and forth (textual criticism), but Westcott-Hort’s text
contains edits which clearly make no sense whatsoever. Unfortunately,
the ESV follows illogical editing as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matthew 25:13 (ESV) Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor
the hour.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Matthew 25:13 (KJV) Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor
the hour <strong>wherein the Son of man cometh</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Watching if you don’t know what time it is makes no sense at all — in
this case it’s not a question of which Greek text proves superior, it’s
an obvious example of editing of God’s Word rendering the
text illogical.</p>
<p>It seems the ESV follows <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2008/03/why-kjv-best-bible-translation.html">Westcott-Hort and their edited text</a>.</p>
<h2>3. Check Cornerstone Verses</h2>
<p>2 Timothy 2:15 is a cornerstone verse, revealing much about <em>how</em> a
translation views its job. Is it literal, or more of a paraphrase?
Wordy, or concise? Consider how various translations handle this verse:</p>
<ul>
<li>KJV — Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that
needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</li>
<li>NASB — Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman
who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word
of truth.</li>
<li>ESV — Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a
worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word
of truth.</li>
<li>RSV — Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a
workman who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word
of truth.</li>
<li>NIV — Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a
workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles
the word of truth.</li>
<li>NLT — Work hard so you can present yourself to God and receive his
approval. Be a good worker, one who does not need to be ashamed and
who correctly explains the word of truth.</li>
</ul>
<p>In line with other recent translations, the ESV waters down “Study” to
“do your best” (NASB uses “be diligent” which is pretty good).</p>
<p>“A worker who has no need to be ashamed” is a bit wordy, that could be
“a worker with no need to be ashamed”. Admittedly that’s a personal
issue, but it seems many of the recent translations chop the text into
shorter sentences, creating some strange constructions.</p>
<p>The ESV changes “Study” to the three words “Do your best” — not only is
it watered down in meaning, but it’s wordy where it doesn’t need to be.
Is “Study” really not clear?</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The ESV doesn’t offer much over other recent translations. If you like
the RSV, NIV, NRSV, and so on, you’ll like the ESV. For those following
the non-corrupt Greek text (KJV, NKJV, and to a lesser extent NASB),
you’ll find little to recommend about the ESV. What happens when the ESV
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/07/southern-baptists-reject-new-niv.html">fades away</a>
as most translations do?</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
