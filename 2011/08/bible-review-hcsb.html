<h2>1. Translator Methods</h2>
<h3>Philosophy</h3>
<p>First item to check: <em>why</em> they felt a new translation was required,
<em>how</em> they did it, and <em>what</em> they used. From their
<a href="http://hcsb.org/about.aspx">about page</a></p>
<p><strong>WHY</strong> — <em>English is changing rapidly, and Bible translations must keep
pace.</em> Well, yes and no. We certainly add new words like computer and
cell-phone, but for a Bible this doesn’t mean much. Of course, if words
<em>change</em> meaning, that’s an issue, but that happens much more slowly.</p>
<p><em>Advances in biblical research provide new data for Bible translators.</em>
If you’re critical of the modern “scholarship” and the critical text
(Alexandrian) this again doesn’t mean much, and actually could be a
<em>bad</em> thing.</p>
<p><strong>HOW</strong> — They call their translation philosophy “optimal equivalence”
as opposed to “formal equivalence” (word for word) or “dynamic
equivalence” (paraphrase). Optimal equivalence seems to be the latest
buzzword, meaning somewhere between literal and paraphrase.
It’s marketing-speak.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It means in the HCSB you’ll find God’s personal name (Yahweh), the use
of “Messiah” in the New Testament, the use of “slave” in the New
Testament, just to name a few examples</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most Bibles translate Yahweh as LORD (in all caps) to distinguish it
from the more general lord meaning ruler. Not a big deal, but since
other translations don’t normally use Yahweh, you might be surprised
about it. It’s not necessarily a bad idea, but if you’re not familiar
with “Christianeze” you might not understand what it is (it’s actually
YHWH, some call it Yahweh, others Jehovah).</p>
<p>The “slave” presents a bigger issue. They translated the Greek “doulos”
as slave — other translations typically use bondslave. It’s not a slave
in the sense we’re used to, the doulos (bondslave) <em>chooses</em> to serve
their master, and has roots in the Old Testament (Exodus 21).</p>
<h3>Textual Base</h3>
<p>They’re using the Alexandrian line:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://hcsb.org/b/authorjournal/archive/2009/11/02/meet-the-hcsb-translation-team.aspx">
<p>Using the most up to date critical texts, Nestle-Aland’s Novum Testamentum 27th ed., the United Bible Societies’ Greek New Testament 4th ed., and Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia 5th&nbsp;ed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we’ve noted in our <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/01/which-bible-translation-best.html">Primer on Bible Translation</a>,
Nestle-Aland and United Bible Societies (UBS) are different names for
what remains essentially Westcott and Hort’s controversial work.</p>
<p>How much did they follow the Alexandrian’s controversial edits? To that
question we shall now consider.</p>
<h2>2. Missing Verses</h2>
<p>It surprises many people when they find out verses have been deleted
from their Bible. Does the HCSB follow Westcott and Hort’s lead? Some
translations — even based on the corrupt Alexandrian Westcott-Hort text
— don’t follow as much as others (NASB is one example which refuses to
delete all the verses Westcott and Hort did).</p>
<p>Let’s see how it stacks up. HCSB verses come from <a href="http://www.mystudybible.com/">My Study
Bible</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>(Matthew 18:11 NKJV) For the Son of Man has come to save that which
was lost.</li>
<li>(Matthew 18:11 HCSB) [For the Son of Man has come to save the lost.]
(FOOTNOTE: “Other mss omit bracketed text”)</li>
</ul>
<p>Verse 11 is in the text, but bracketed as missing in some manuscripts
(those manuscripts being the corrupt Westcott-Hort / Alexandrian).</p>
<ul>
<li>(Revelation 11:17 NKJV) saying: We give You thanks, O Lord God
Almighty, The One who is and who was and who is to come, Because You
have taken Your great power and reigned.</li>
<li>(Revelation 11:17 HCSB) saying: We thank You, Lord God, the
Almighty, who is and who was, (FOOTNOTE: “Other mss add and who is
to come”)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we’ve come to a <em>huge</em> problem, as <em>the HCSB translators didn’t tell
you what the “other mss” are</em>. In Matthew 18, the “other mss” are
Westcott-Hort, while in Revelation 11, the “other mss” are
Textus-Receptus. They’ve chosen one textual line over the other in some
places, but neglected to inform the reader which one.</p>
<p>That’s a <em>BIG</em> problem. Even as we spend considerable time studying
Bible translations, we’d be hard pressed to immediately identify which
textual line every footnote refers to. It’s a big problem hopefully
they’ll fix.</p>
<ul>
<li>Matthew 25:13 (HCSB) Therefore be alert, because you don’t know
either the day or the hour. (FOOTNOTE: “Other mss add in which the
Son of Man is coming.”)</li>
<li>Matthew 25:13 (KJV) Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor
the hour <strong>wherein the Son of man cometh</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Watching if you don’t know what time it is makes no sense at all — in
this case it’s not a question of which Greek text proves superior, it’s
an obvious example of editing of God’s Word rendering the
text illogical.</p>
<p>This is a sad following of the Alexandrian line — would someone tell you
to keep watch because you don’t know what time it is? That makes <em>no</em>
sense at all. You keep watch because you don’t know what time some event
will occur (Jesus returns, enemy attacks, time for dinner, someone else
takes over the watch, etc).</p>
<p>In this case, the “other mss” means Textus-Receptus.</p>
<h2>3. Check Cornerstone Verses</h2>
<p>2 Timothy 2:15 remains a cornerstone verse, revealing much about <em>how</em> a
translation views its job. Is it literal, or more of a paraphrase?
Wordy, or concise? Consider how various translations handle this verse:</p>
<ul>
<li>KJV — Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that
needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</li>
<li>NASB — Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman
who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word
of truth.</li>
<li>HCSB — Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who
doesn’t need to be ashamed, correctly teaching the word of truth.</li>
<li>NIV — Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a
workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles
the word of truth.</li>
<li>NLT — Work hard so you can present yourself to God and receive his
approval. Be a good worker, one who does not need to be ashamed and
who correctly explains the word of truth.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Be diligent” is fairly good translation — much preferred over “do your
best”, or “work hard”.</p>
<p>“Correctly teaching” isn’t quite right, it’s correctly handling.
Teaching might imply this verse is for pastors, but it’s meant for
everyone as you must study the Bible yourself.</p>
<h3>Bonus: Ephesians 6</h3>
<p>The HCSB seems to be a cross, so to get a admittedly biased idea of
style, a passage I’m quite familiar with is Ephesians 6:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, be strengthened by the Lord and by His vast strength. 11 Put
on the full armor of God so that you can stand against the tactics [e]
of the Devil. 12 For our battle is not against flesh and blood, but
against the rulers, against the authorities, against the world powers
of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavens.
13 This is why you must take up the full armor of God, so that you may
be able to resist in the evil day, and having prepared everything, to
take your stand. 14 Stand, therefore, with truth like a belt around
your waist,righteousness like armor on your chest, 15 and your feet
sandaled with readiness for the gospel of peace. [f] 16 In every
situation take the shield of faith, and with it you will be able to
extinguish the flaming arrows of the evil one. 17 Take the helmet of
salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is God’s word.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The footnote [e] notes “tactics” in the text can also be schemes, or
tricks. It would be preferred to put those in the text instead, as
“tactics” is a <em>general</em> term, while scheme is a specific tactic. In
this case they’ve generalized a specific meaning. Why they choose to do
that would be an interesting question for the translators, especially
when they provide the specific term in a footnote.</p>
<p>Verse 13 says “you must take up”, which implies more of an order (which
it is).</p>
<p>On a personal note we’ll admit we’re quite used to the majestic use of
the KJV. Overall this paragraph isn’t too bad.</p>
<h3>Bonus: John 7</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into
Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest. For
there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh
to be known openly. If thou do these things, show thyself to the
world. (John 7:3–4 KJV)</p>
<p>so His brothers said to Him, “Leave here and go to Judea so Your
disciples can see Your works that You are doing. For no one does
anything in secret while he’s seeking public recognition. If You do
these things, show Yourself to the world.” (John 7:3–4 HCSB)</p>
<p>Jesus’ brothers urged him to go to Judea for the celebration. “Go
where your followers can see your miracles!” they scoffed. “You can’t
become a public figure if you hide like this! If you can do such
wonderful things, prove it to the world!” (John 7:3–4 NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, the paraphrased NLT brings out the meaning better — Jesus’
brothers were taunting Him a bit, saying “show your stuff”. In John 7
you might miss that if you haven’t referred to a paraphrase, and the
HCSB follows most translations.</p>
<p>In fairness to the HCSB, it’s not their intent to create a paraphrase.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The text appears well-footnoted with explanations. It seems — similar to
the NASB — the HCSB tries to take a middle approach to Westcott-Hort’s
edits of the text.</p>
<p>While the HCSB states it’s based on the Westcott-Hort textual line, they
do reject some of the silly and absurd changes Westcott and Hort made to
the text. Why the HCSB doesn’t just use the preferred Textus-Receptus
instead remains a mystery only the translators could answer.</p>
<p>The HCSB appears to surpass the NIV (and most definitely the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/07/southern-baptists-reject-new-niv.html">new 2011 NIV</a>
the Southern Baptists rejected) for those looking for a modern-language
translation. If you’re in the NIV camp and don’t like the 2011 revised
NIV, you might find something to like in the HCSB, if you don’t like the
reigning Bible translation champion KJV/NKJV.</p>
<p>For years we’ve recommended the KJV/NKJV for serious study, and for a
paraphrase a New Living as the “modern language” style. We frequently
start new Christians with the NLT, and then move them to the NKJV; we
don’t see anything in the HCSB to replace the venerated KJV as a literal
translation, though for some uses it could be used as “starter” Bible in
place of the NLT.</p>
<p>If they will just correct the nasty footnote problem — that’s a
show-stopper for serious use.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
