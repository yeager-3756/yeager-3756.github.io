  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>It’s not the search for the Holy Grail man has obsessed with over the
centuries, it’s the search for the free lunch — the idea you can have
your cake and eat it too, weight loss without exercise or diet changes,
get rich quick, and so on. This error infects politicians, science,
economists, and now, even the church.</p>
<p><strong>Unfortunately, reality <em>always</em> wins</strong>, as the illusion of the free
lunch (something for nothing) crashes and burns like a 747 running out
of fuel at 35,000 feet. It’s not going to end well.</p>
<h2>The Economic Free Lunch</h2>
<p>Keynesian economics in one sentence: You (and everyone else) can have a
free lunch (stimulus and deficit spending), and nobody ever has to pay
for it (or it’s paid for by someone else).</p>
<p>Obama <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/04/increasing-federal-deficit.html">spending adds Trillions in debt</a>,
while congress <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/08/debt-deal-disaster.html">increases the debt $2.4 Trillion</a> more.</p>
<p>Imagine your personal finances — you earn $2,000 per month, but spend
$3,000, something you’ve been doing for <em>years</em>. How long would the
bank allow you to do that? Suppose the bank called you on it, and you
replied “Sure, next month I’ll only spend $2,900”. Only insane people
would do such a thing … or those deluded into thinking a free
lunch exists.</p>
<p>The reason people believe the free lunch fails for personal finances,
but <em>does</em> work for the Federal Government comes from a bizarre belief
government can violate the <em>law of free lunches</em> (well, that and the
government’s ability to print money, but that doesn’t end well either —
see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_in_the_Weimar_Republic">Weimar Republic</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>,
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/11/buzzword-alert-quantitative-easing.html">Quantitative Easing</a>, etc).</p>
<p>There is no free lunch, or to paraphrase Margret Thatcher — “Socialism
is great until you run out of other peoples money”.</p>
<h2>The “Green” Engineering Free Lunch</h2>
<p>Way back during the energy-crunch 1970’s, a building company in Southern
California (Presley Company) got involved in a machine which split water
atoms into hydrogen and oxygen, with the promise of continuous, free,
clean, green, energy — the goracle would be proud.</p>
<p>Presley’s stock soared from $6 to $20 … before the SEC halted trading.
You see, <strong>the device only had one problem</strong> — it promised the elusive
free lunch.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://articles.latimes.com/1986-01-06/local/me-13510_1_trial-date" title="LA Times">
<p>A Newport Beach home builder’s fascination with a “hydrogen converter,” which he believed would produce an endless supply of cheap power during the energy crisis in the mid-1970s, ended up costing the Presley Cos. $4.4 million and years of&nbsp;embarrassment.</p>
<p>… a battery of scientific tests, including some paid for by The Times, found that although the patented device produced hydrogen gas from tap water by relying on chemical reactions, it apparently did not produce more energy than it consumed, as&nbsp;promised.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Splitting water (H₂O) atoms into oxygen and hydrogen isn’t really a big
deal, the problem is entropy — any engineering or mechanical process is
<em>always</em> less than 100% efficient. Simply put, the device did work, it
just cost more in electricity to use than than the hydrogen provided!</p>
<p>Any physicist would quickly spot the problem, as…</p>
<p>…there is no free lunch — entropy <em>always</em> wins.</p>
<h2>The Christian Free Lunch</h2>
<p>The heresy of <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">social justice</a>
and the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/05/church-common-good.html">church as the common good</a> use
something similar: a free lunch exists (paid by someone else), as long
as the church lobbies government to do what Christians should
do: charity.</p>
<p>Fantastic … using social justice you can be charitable while keeping
your big-screen TV and Lexus! See, a free lunch exists!</p>
<p>But then reality strikes: those promoting social justice use it to ease
their conscience by stealing from someone else to redistribute,
deceiving themselves into believing they’re being “charitable”.</p>
<p>Not charitable, just deceptive, greedy, and coveting their
neighbors possessions.</p>
<p>It’s ironic when <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/12/social-justice-gets-what-they-want-dont-it.html">social justice gets what it wants they don’t like it</a>,
for <strong>social justice boils down to greed</strong> — wanting what someone else
has (even if it’s to redistribute to someone else as “charity”). As long
as it’s someone <em>else’s</em> possessions being redistributed through social
justice, that’s great … but hands off <em>my</em> stuff!</p>
<h3>It’s Not Biblical</h3>
<p><strong>You’ll <em>never</em> find social justice in the Bible</strong> — the idea
Christians should lobby the government to forcefully take from one
person and give to another. Charity is <em>your</em> job, taking care of the
needy is <em>your</em> job.</p>
<p>Those promoting radical social justice as a Biblical idea are heretics.
Strong language, but the deception contains nothing more than poisonous
radical political ideology wrapped in a thin candy shell hoping people
swallow the candy without noticing the poison.</p>
<p><strong>Ask social justice promoters</strong> where Jesus, Paul, or any of the
apostles spoke of forced income or property redistribution via a secular
government and you’ll be met with a blank stare — they <em>know</em> it’s not
Biblical, thus heretical (by definition).</p>
<p>There is no free lunch, it remains <em>your</em> responsibility to help those
in need.</p>
<h2>Another Christian Free Lunch</h2>
<p>Too many Christians sit in pews week after month believing it’s the
pastors job to advise them, counsel them, and handle problems. Sadly,
those pew-warmers end up in deep doggy-do-do when they get that 3AM
phone call … and have no idea how to handle it.</p>
<p>At 3AM, you’ve got what you’ve got, and if you’re unprepared because you
think your pastor will bail you out you’ll be crushed when reality
strikes — as it <em>always</em> will. It’s <em>your</em> job to know the Bible, it’s
<em>your</em> job to practice with the armor of God, it’s <em>your</em> job to make
application to <em>your</em> life.</p>
<p>There is no free lunch — nope, this one won’t work either.</p>
<h2>No Free Lunch… Ever</h2>
<p>You might be familiar with the three laws of thermodynamics,
paraphrased as:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can’t win.</li>
<li>You can’t even break even.</li>
<li>You can’t get out of the game.</li>
</ol>
<p>The laws of physics prove <em>there is no free lunch</em>.</p>
<p>Reality <em>always</em> wins, which is why socialism <em>always</em> fails — no matter
if it’s a government (Keynesian economics), or the church (social
justice), or engineering (perpetual motion machines).</p>
<p>There is no free lunch — don’t be a reality-denier.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
