<p>One danger these days involves the use of feelings instead of facts. If
you’ve been in a public school you’re quite aware of the problem (John
Loeffler says we’ve gone from being right to feeling good about being
wrong). Unfortunately, that disease infects the church as well, and it’s
not a new problem.</p>
<p>Way back in the oldest book of the Bible, after Job loses everything his
three “friends” appear on the scene, say nothing for a week, and when
they finally speak, what do they say? Rely on the Word of God? Prayer?
Nope. Feeeeelings … nothing more than feeeelings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap
the same. (Job 4:8)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the next 30 chapters, that’s the theme. Job, you <em>must</em> have done
something wrong — some sin, some evil — for this great calamity to come
upon you, <em>for that’s what I’ve seen</em>.</p>
<p>In other words, experience based religion.</p>
<p>Think about this the next time you’re relying on feelings instead of
facts, and remember the problem with the emerging-this, purpose-that,
post-modern philosophy sweeping through the church destroying many in
its tidal wave of filth — the denial of absolute truth, substituting
feelings for facts.</p>
<p>Thou shalt not do this.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few thousand years to the time of Christ,
and—surprise—the problem still exits. Peter of course was a man of
action (even when silence was called for), lived with Christ, ate with
Christ, lived with Christ.</p>
<p>If <em>anyone</em> knew Christ, it was Peter.</p>
<p>Yet what does he say in his letter regarding relying on
experience-based religion?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known
unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were
eyewitnesses of his majesty. (2 Peter 1:6)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was <em>there</em> Peter says. Remember who was on the mount of
transfiguration? Yep, that was me. Walking on water with Jesus? Me
again. The last supper? Still me (okay, denying Christ three times was
me too, but nobody’s perfect).</p>
<p>Get the idea? If <em>anyone</em> could rely on experience and feelings, it’s
Peter. Yet he warns of <em>not</em> doing that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that
ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the
day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts (2 Peter 1:19)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even for the guy who was there, the guy who (along with James and John)
knew Jesus best, Peter warns us <em>not to rely on experience, but the Word
of God</em>.</p>
<p>Why then in the
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/11/post-modern-philosophy-church.html">post-this</a>,
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/06/red-letter-christianity-clueless-about-sin.html">emerging-that</a>,
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">social justice</a>,
and other “modern” movements return to what we <em>know</em> we’ve been warned
against? <strong>Are those leaders knowingly leading people astray, or are
they uninformed and unlearned</strong>?</p>
<p>Either way, <strong>if you choose to follow their misinformation, you’re
toast</strong>.</p>
<p>Now that <em>you</em> know the dangers of replacing the Word of God with
feelings, will you heed the warning of Peter, or listen to slick
<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/snake+oil">snake-oil salesmen</a>
trying to get you <em>away</em> from the bedrock of God’s Word?</p>
<p>Because at 3AM, you’ve got what you’ve got, and you <em>don’t</em> want what
you grab for at 3AM to be useless snake oil … unless you like <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/09/matrix-guide-christianity.html">living in
the Matrix</a>.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
