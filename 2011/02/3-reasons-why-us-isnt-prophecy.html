  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>People wonder why the United States doesn’t play a role in end-times
prophecy. Some believe after the rapture most of the country will be
gone, thus the country essentially ceases to exist. Others have
different theories; in the end they’re all guesses.</p>
<p>Perhaps a quote from the past sheds some light on it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>America is like a healthy body and its resistance is threefold: its
patriotism, its morality, and its spiritual life. If we can undermine
these three areas, America will collapse from within. (Stalin)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three things the United States has going for it (according to Stalin):</p>
<ol>
<li>Patriotism</li>
<li>Morality</li>
<li>Spiritual life</li>
</ol>
<p>Stalin believed corrupting those three would cause the country to
collapse. So how are we doing?</p>
<p><strong>Patriotism became a four-letter word</strong>. It’s fashionable to believe
the country is inherently bad and evil — or even causes most of the
problems in the world. Two views exist: The first acknowledges the
country makes mistakes, but remains basically good and stands for
liberty, while the other believes it’s mainly bad and evil, and needs to
be “fundamentally transformed” into something else, with more control
over citizens and less liberty (here and abroad) — a new world order.</p>
<p><strong>Morality sunk to new lows</strong> as value relativism took over. With TV
programming continuing to sink lower and lower, not even the family hour
remains safe from the toxic ooze seeping across the country (oops, they
call that “pop culture” now). As the country abandons God, atheist
theology declares <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/12/problem-morality-where-does-it-come.html">value relativism</a>
and even claims <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/06/more-dawkins-morality-no-absolutes.html">no absolutes exist</a>.
In other words, everyone does what is right in their own eyes, and the
only absolute is the idea <strong>no absolutes exist</strong> (the one thing value
relativists proclaim — absolutely).</p>
<p><strong>Spiritual life in decay</strong>. As we see bizarre doctrine infecting the
church — in some cases even <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">replacing the Gospel of Jesus</a>,
the average church-goer fails to defend the true gospel against
counterfeits due to both the failure of pastors to teach truth, and
failure of people to “vote with their feet” and leave churches failing
to adequately teach truth.</p>
<p>Will Stalin be proved correct? Could these three ideas cause the
collapse of the country, and perhaps that’s why it’s not in prophecy?</p>
<p>We certainly don’t know the future, or can provide a reason why the
United States doesn’t appear. However, <strong>it’s time for the church to
stand up and get the country to reverse course</strong> back from where it
came, as the road it’s on will not provide a happy ending.</p>
<p>It’s time for an <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/05/future-united-states.html">action plan for the future</a>.
Three simple ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Study your Bible. Once or twice a week during church won’t get the
job done. If you’re intimately familiar with the truth, you’ll
quickly spot counterfeit gospels.</li>
<li>Study the Armor of God — you must understand and properly use the
tools God’s given you.</li>
<li>Get involved. Make your opinion known, and support those candidates
and positions espousing Biblical principles, and shun those failing
the test.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the country abandons God, it’s because the people allow it, and if it
be Godly, it’s because the people demand it.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
