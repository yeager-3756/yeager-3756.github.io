  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Sojourners (Jim Wallis and co.) got into a bit of hot water when they
rejected an advertisement sponsored by a gay-rights group. Since
Sojourners promotes policies of the left, the group become upset with
Wallis’ Sojourners (Sojourners later accepted another ad from the group,
so the controversy appears to have diminished a bit). The question
remains, what exactly does a liberal “Christian” believe?</p>
<p>When Jim Wallis claims <q cite="http://blog.sojo.net/2011/09/29/defining-%E2%80%9Cevangelicals%E2%80%9D-in-an-election-year/">I love my liberal church friends, but am more
theologically conservative. I have many allies on the religious left,
but I am not a member of it</q>, after reading the following does Wallis’
statement sound true?</p>
<p>Let’s hear from Jim Wallis’ group <em>in their own words</em>, and ask yourself
does what Wallis’ group proclaim align with the Bible?</p>
<h2>Abortion</h2>
<blockquote cite="http://www.sojo.net/index.cfm?action=about_us.issues_faq" title="Sojourners">
<p>Dramatically reduce abortion. Our society should support common ground policies that dramatically reduce the abortion rate by preventing unwanted pregnancies, providing meaningful alternatives and necessary supports for women and children, and reforming adoption laws.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s certainly not a pro-life position, sounding almost like a line
from President Clinton: abortion should be safe, legal, and rare. So
abortion is fine as long it’s reduced?</p>
<p>Abortion terminates a life. If abortion is wrong, it’s wrong, and if
right, it’s right … the <em>number</em> of abortions makes no difference on
whether it’s right or wrong.</p>
<h2>Capital Punishment</h2>
<blockquote cite="http://www.sojo.net/index.cfm?action=about_us.issues_faq" title="Sojourners">
<p>End capital punishment. A consistent ethic demands that our nation end capital punishment. We should not take life to punish wrongful death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a group frequently using the Old Testament law to justify their
“social justice” positions, it’s rather bizarre they then reject the Old
Testament position on capital punishment (though Sojourners’ “social
justice” and capital punishment stands just <em>happen</em> to agree 100% with
the political ideology of the left. We’re sure it’s just coincidental).</p>
<p>They’ve joined many others in only <strong>using the parts of the Bible
agreeing with their pre-determined ideology</strong>, a fact demonstrated by
their differing position on capital punishment and social justice. The
inconsistencies demonstrate views more concerned with radical ideology
rather than traditional Biblical theology.</p>
<h2>Economy and Taxes</h2>
<blockquote cite="http://www.sojo.net/index.cfm?action=about_us.issues_faq" title="Sojourners">
<p>What your position on the domestic economy and taxes?</p>
<p>Budgets are moral documents. Budgets are moral documents that reflect the values and priorities of a family, church, organization, city, state, or nation. Examining budget priorities is a moral and religious concern. Our political leadership’s tax cut mentality ignores “the least of these”—leaving them with crumbs from the feast of the comfortable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it moral to run up <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/04/increasing-federal-deficit.html">Trillions in debt</a>?
The recent <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/08/debt-deal-disaster.html">budget deal added $30,000 to your (and your children’s) credit card</a>. Is
that moral?</p>
<p>Of course not, yet social justice promoters lobby for theft of your
children’s (and their children’s) money (didn’t I hear somewhere about
“thou shalt not steal”?). Instead of arguing about how much <em>more</em> we
should go in debt, <strong>the <em>moral</em> question is how should we allocate our
limited resources</strong>, instead of spending our children’s money?</p>
<p>Of course, <strong>you’ll never find anywhere Jesus or the apostles stating
the church should lobby</strong> a secular government to forcefully confiscate
possessions of one person for redistribution as it sees fit, so “social
justice” has no leg to stand on for the
redistribution-is-Christian idea.</p>
<h2>Education</h2>
<blockquote cite="http://www.sojo.net/index.cfm?action=about_us.issues_faq" title="Sojourners">
<p>Do you support vouchers?</p>
<p>What vouchers do is provide hope—and the chance at a decent education—for a few families that might otherwise not be able to afford such options. What vouchers don’t—and can’t—do is fix what ails the system of public education in this country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/01/failure-public-education.html">Government (aka public) education has failed</a>
as more and more people choose
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/10/homeschooling-vs-public-education.html">homeschooling</a>.</p>
<p>Pouring more borrowed money into a broken system won’t solve the problem
(we’ve tried that, and it doesn’t work). We <em>know</em> what works, the
question remains, why won’t the educational establishment use it? <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204226204576601232986845102.html">What if the NFL played by school rules?</a>
— would the game be better, or worse? In that scenario, would pouring
more money into the NFL improve the game at all?</p>
<h2>Social Justice</h2>
<blockquote cite="http://www.sojo.net/index.cfm?action=about_us.issues_faq" title="Sojourners">
<p>Why do you think government should solve social problems? Isn’t that the role of the church? </p>
<p>There is a biblical role for the state, just as there is for the church. And they are not the same. According to Romans 13, the state is supposed to uphold the rule of law by protecting the innocent and punishing the guilty. It suggests a clear role for the government in ensuring the common good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jim Wallis expresses <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">confusion on the gospel</a>,
a completely <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/06/christians-government-romans-13.html">wrong idea on Romans 13</a>,
while other “social justice” groups have <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/06/red-letter-christianity-clueless-about-sin.html">no idea what sin is</a>,
and clueless about <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/05/church-common-good.html">the common good</a>.</p>
<p>With such basic concepts as the gospel and sin completely misunderstood,
<strong>should you trust theologically liberal political movements for
Biblical ideas?</strong> CS Lewis warned of the danger social justice poses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the other hand we do want, and want very much, to make men treat
Christianity as a means; preferably, of course, as a means to their
own advancement, but, failing that, as a means to anything—even to
social justice. The thing to do is get a man at first to value social
justice as a thing which the Enemy demands, and work him on to the
stage at which he values Christianity because it may produce social
justice. … I have found a passage in a Christian writer where he
recommends his own version of Christianity on the ground that “only
such a faith can outlast the death of old cultures and new
civilizations.” You see the little rift? “Believe this, not because it
is true, but for some other reason”. That’s the game. (“The Screwtape
Letters” page 119–120)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You won’t find forced redistribution, theft, or other parts of social
justice taught by Jesus, Paul, Peter, John or anyone else in the New
Testament. Period. You’ll find much about your <em>individual</em> role for
charity, but never stating the church should lobby the government,
transfer individual responsibility to a Godless government, “soak the
rich”, wealth transfer, equality of outcome, or other popular social
justice themes.</p>
<p>Those simply don’t exist in the New Testament — social justice exists as
a far-left <em>political</em> movement, not a Christian one.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Jim Wallis expresses neither theologically nor politically conservative
ideas — they’re almost exclusively far-left. He’s free to promote
whatever he wants, but why call it conservative when it’s not?</p>
<p>It’s abundantly clear liberal <strong>progressive “Christianity” lines up
almost 100% with far-left, liberal, progressive politics</strong>. Judge for
yourself if the previous positions (both political and theological) line
up with the Bible or not.</p>
<p>Social justice, the counterfeit Christian gospel, the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/03/atheism-poison-liberal-theology.html">poison of progressive theology</a>,
and the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/03/coming-church-division.html">coming church division</a>
shows the church will soon split into a traditional Biblical theology
group, and a group calling themselves (among other names) progressive,
liberal “Christians”, but holding no Christian theology at all as they
choose to <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/09/matrix-guide-christianity.html">live in The Matrix</a> of deception instead of the reality of the Bible.</p>
<p>Which group do you want to be in?</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
