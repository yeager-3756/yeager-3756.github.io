<p>A curious trend among some modern Christian movements (progressive,
liberal, post-this, emerging-that, etc) <strong>you’ll frequently hear liberal
“Christians” claim part of the Bible doesn’t apply today</strong>, or what Paul
meant was really this, or this is an allegory for that — arguing for
anything <em>but</em> what the text clearly says. Naturally this causes
problems, as who gets to say what the text says, if it doesn’t say what
it clearly does?</p>
<p>In the end, you’re left with a designer pick-n-choose religion,
not Christianity.</p>
<p>This malady of butchering the text doesn’t occur in normal conversation.
Suppose I texted you to an invite for dinner Friday. Would you argue
about what did I really mean? Was it really an invitation to a hockey
game? Or was it just a cultural idiom?</p>
<p>You’ll laugh at such absurdities, yet that’s exactly what some do to the
Bible. When Paul wrote about xyz, he didn’t really mean xyz, he really
meant abc. Or this isn’t really in the Bible, but you should believe
it anyway.</p>
<p>Bizarre. Tactics of rebellion are these.</p>
<h2>Rebellion</h2>
<p><strong>You’re free to accept or reject the Bible</strong> as you wish, but groups
like social justice movements, liberal progressive “Christianity”, and
so on (whatever is the latest buzzword) all do the same thing — deny
what the Bible says (read that: rebel against God) — using two
main tactics:</p>
<ol>
<li>That was for another time, the Bible needs to fit in with today’s
society so that part doesn’t apply.</li>
<li>That doesn’t really mean what it says, it’s actually an
allegory for…</li>
</ol>
<p>Using their liberal methods proves <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/04/jesus-was-republican-not-democrat.html">Jesus was a Reagan Conservative</a>
who despises Democrats — and it’s <em>impossible</em> to prove otherwise. Go
ahead, try — you’ll fail.</p>
<h2>Reject the Bible as you Wish - just don’t rewrite it.</h2>
<p>If you don’t like the Bible, fine. It’s your choice. But you look rather
foolish claiming when Paul said one thing (and it’s abundantly clear),
he really meant something completely different.</p>
<p>Those “Christians” (and we use the term loosely) live in <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/09/matrix-guide-christianity.html">the deceptive world of The Matrix</a>.
<strong>Why they choose to call themselves Christian as they reject large
swaths of the Bible</strong> is a question only they can answer. They may like
the name, but they sure don’t like the doctrine.</p>
<p>We’ll note it’s a standard Saul Alinsky method you don’t have to <em>be</em>
moral, but you have to cloak yourself in morality for people to buy what
you’re shoveling. In other words, you don’t have to <em>be</em> Christian, but
you have to <em>appear</em> Christian to trick the church into accepting what
you’re peddling — which many times <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">directly contradicts the Bible</a>.</p>
<p>Saul Alinsky dedicated his book (“Rules for Radicals”) to Satan and
rebellion, so the question becomes — why do people who claim to be
Christian use methods designed to deceive, and dedicated to Satan?</p>
<p>Tactics of rebellion are these.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
