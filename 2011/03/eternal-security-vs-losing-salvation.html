  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Through the years, one of the most popular articles on this site
involves <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2008/01/can-you-lose-your-salvation.html">losing salvation</a>,
drawing some rather heated comments. It appears many people struggle
with this issue, especially the Hebrews six passage (read the linked
article for the full analysis). Since this topic causes so much anxiety
and problems, let’s step back and consider it from a different angle.</p>
<p>First, it’s difficult for some people to accept if they did nothing to
earn their salvation, that means they can do nothing to lose it. Most
people accept salvation is by faith alone, not works, but are unable to
arrive at the conclusion that also means <strong>you can do nothing to lose
your salvation either</strong>.</p>
<p>Math contains a concept called indirect proof. You begin with a
statement (assumption), then logically follow where that statement
leads, and if it arrives at an impossibility or absurdity, the original
statement <em>must</em> be false. Indirect proof is also called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction">proof by contradiction</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s <strong>apply indirect proof to the possibility of losing salvation</strong>.</p>
<p>First, assume it <em>is</em> possible to lose your salvation, where does that
assumption lead you?</p>
<ol>
<li>You <em>can</em> lose your salvation.</li>
<li>Thus, your actions cause either a keeping or losing of salvation.</li>
<li>Thus, salvation is based on your actions.</li>
<li>Thus, salvation is works-based.</li>
<li>Additionally, Jesus’ death on the cross was insufficient for
salvation, and requires our works to complete the job.</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously, numbers four and five are absurd, thus the original statement
(you can lose your salvation), is false.
<a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Q.E.D.">QED</a>. In the
end, the possibility of losing salvation requires the following
two ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Salvation is by works, not faith.</li>
<li>Jesus’ sacrifice was insufficient.</li>
</ol>
<p>Neither of those are good choices, but for those who believe it’s
possible to lose your salvation, those are the logical conclusions
you’ll arrive at. Since they’re both absurd, the original assumption you
can lose your salvation must be false.</p>
<p>Many pastors and others suggest to those struggling with salvation to
read 1 John. We’ve just published a book on <a href="https://framesofreferencellc.com/catalog/9780983111726/">Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of
Security</a>, (ISBN
978-0-9831117-2-6) if you’re interested in a study of 1 John.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
