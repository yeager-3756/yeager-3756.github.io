  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Everyone has bias. The trick is not letting those ideas prevent you from
seeing the truth, or modifying your position when new facts dictate.
Confirmation bias creeps in when — instead of seeing the facts — you see
everything as proof of your position.</p>
<p>For example, it’s no secret Sojourners (Jim Wallis and friends) promote
extreme far-left socialist ideology (income redistribution, big
government, high taxes, collective salvation, etc). They’re free to do
as they wish, the problem arises when they try to make the Bible fit
their position (and claim all Christians should follow heretical
ideology), in spite of what the text says.</p>
<p>Here’s a classic example of confirmation bias in action:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://blog.sojo.net/2011/04/25/ayn-rand-manicheanism-and-christianity/#comment-191775878">
<p>…let’s take the parable of the rich fool. We miss this part because it’s not actually in the text, but it would have been understood that part of the reason God was displeased was because <i>he didn’t consult with his neighbors</i> before determining what he should do with his&nbsp;blessing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When someone admits the text doesn’t support their claim, but then turn
around and claim the text supports exactly their extreme ideology,
that’s an example of confirmation bias. In this example, right after
admitting the text doesn’t provide evidence, the person proceeds to give
God the exact characteristics (collectivism, collective salvation, etc)
he admits aren’t in the text, putting words in God’s mouth (which isn’t
a good idea).</p>
<p>Here’s another example:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://blog.sojo.net/2011/04/25/ayn-rand-manicheanism-and-christianity/#comment-192174845">
<p>Can the church be considered a collective? I would answer in the affirmative. I say that not as a non <span class="sic">beliver</span> but as a member of a Christian fundamentalist church who has accepted the teachings of Christ as laid out in the Bible. Of course we must decide as individuals as to whether or not we accept Jesus as our savior. But, once we decide to follow Jesus we <span class="sic">beome</span> part of a body of believers that exists for the common good. Using Jesus as our example we <span class="sic">beome</span> servants of mankind&nbsp;…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This person also admits the Bible speaks of <em>individual</em> salvation
(true), but then tries to stuff the truth into heretical ideas of
collective salvation and social justice. Naturally, this requires a bit
of twisting (where does the Bible state the church exists for the
“collective good” — forced income redistribution and social works from a
Godless government?).</p>
<p>Does your head hurt yet? That’s the kind of verbal twister people engage
in to prove extreme false ideology like social justice and collective
salvation — even <em>supporters</em> of those ideas admit they’re not found in
the text they claim “proves” their position. Confirmation bias at it’s
best (as well as cognitive dissonance, what Orwell called
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/06/what-doublethink.html">doublethink</a>
— the idea of holding conflicting ideas and believing
both simultaneously).</p>
<h2>The Bible Forms Ideology, not the Other Way Around</h2>
<p>Those are extreme examples of confirmation bias, which must be avoided
if you want to use critical thinking. Don’t come to the Bible with your
ideology and try to make it fit, allow the Bible to form your ideology.</p>
<p>If you don’t, at best you’ll end up looking rather silly (as well as
making large errors in analysis and logic). At worst, you’ll make
devastating theological errors — some have even promoted <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">heretical alternate gospels</a>
appearing nowhere in the Biblical text.</p>
<p>Once you can justify what <em>isn’t</em> in the text, you’re on your way to
cultdom. Or as Chuck Missler says, “never underestimate a persons’
ability to rationalize”, as the liberal social justice crowd abandons
the Bible (and rational thought) for their own designer religion — one
in which the Bible takes a secondary role to radical ideology.</p>
<h2>Logic Proves Heresies False</h2>
<p>Heresies have come and gone since the beginning of the church, today’s
problem is many people can’t think logically, and thus are susceptible
to new waves of heresy blowing through the church — heresies which logic
and critical thinking clearly reject. The inability to think clearly
results from a <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/10/homeschooling-vs-public-education.html">failure of pubic education</a>
which has turned out millions of people who can no longer discuss and
debate ideas.</p>
<p>As we’ve recommend in the past, a good book for logic is Jason Lisle’s
“Discerning Truth” (ISBN 978-0890515945) which presents a good
foundation to the subject. It’s really an easy read, so if you’re
expecting a dry textbook on logic you’ll be disappointed.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
