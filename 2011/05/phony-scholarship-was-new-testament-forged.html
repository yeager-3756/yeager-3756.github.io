  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Mr. Bart Ehrman (who calls himself a “renowned Bible scholar”) returns
with a new book, this time claiming most of the New Testament was
forged. We won’t analyze much of his “scholarship” because similarly to
the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2008/12/deutero-isaiah-hypothesis.html">Deutero-Isaiah Hypothesis</a>,
it only takes a few minutes to discover the “scholarship” has no basis
in sound logic and analysis.</p>
<p>In this case, Mr. Ehrman takes aim at the apostle Paul:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/05/13/half-of-new-testament-forged-bible-scholar-says/">
<p>The scholar also points to a famous passage in 1 Corinthians in which Paul is recorded as saying that women should be “silent” in churches and that “if they wish to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at&nbsp;home.”</p>
<p>Only three chapters earlier, in the same book, Paul is urging women who pray and prophesy in church to cover their heads with veils, Ehrman says: “If they were allowed to speak in chapter 11, how could they be told not to speak in chapter&nbsp;14?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Answer: Because Mr. Erhman has no idea what he’s talking about. Instead
of letting the text speak for itself, he <em>wants</em> to see errors and
problems where none exist. Since we wrote a book on 1 Corinthians, we’ll
simply quote <a href="https://framesofreferencellc.com/catalog/9780983111702/">The Troubled Church</a> on
this passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember the focus of this section — order in the church service. This
verse results from a cultural issue existing in that day as women sat
on one side, while men sat on the other.</p>
<p>During the service women asked questions by shouting across the room
to their husbands. Paul reminds them of proper order; if a lady had a
question, don’t interrupt the service, wait until they arrived home.
In the context of previous verses, all must be in order and not
confusion — it’s not a prohibition of women speaking in church as Paul
already spoke of women praying and prophesying in chapter 11. <strong>Those
seeking to apply this verse to a global ban haven’t done their
homework</strong>.<br />
<cite>“The Troubled Church”, page 153–154 ISBN 978-0-9831117-0-2</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ve noted <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/05/pseudo-scholarship-why-do-people-suffer.html">Mr. Erhman’s pseudo-scholarship</a>
before, as once again he reveals a total and complete lack of
understanding of the text — a level so complete even <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/06/pseudo-scholarship-even-atheists-dismiss.html">atheists reject his arguments</a>,
a group which certainly wants any reason to doubt the Bible as it was
written, yet they honestly note Ehrman’s total lack of actual
scholarship, along with his contradictions and inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Mr. Ehrman provides yet another warning — just because someone might
have a PhD behind their name, calling themselves a renowned scholar,
doesn’t mean you should lend any more credence to their theories than
someone claiming the moon is made of cheese.</p>
<p>Next time we’ll discuss more credible ideas, like the moon landing hoax
… or the Easter bunny.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
