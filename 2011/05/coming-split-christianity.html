  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>We’ve talked before about the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/03/coming-church-division.html">coming church division</a>,
but it’s interesting even liberal progressive “Christians” have come to
the conclusion a split will soon come.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.redletterchristians.org/digging-deeper-the-coming-evangelical-split/">
<p>I believe we’ll eventually find two basic coalitions: Traditional Evangelicals and Progressive Evangelicals.&nbsp;… </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to state how each group views the Bible:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional — The Bible is the inspired, inerrant, authoritative
Word of God.</li>
<li>Liberal — Christianity is a “lifestyle”, with the Bible of less
importance. Thus, social justice becomes more important than the
Bible (which makes since, since <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">social justice isn’t <em>in</em> the Bible</a>,
you’ll have to minimize the Bible if you’re for social justice), or
as the author said “the emphasis is more on growth thru the process
of work and serving others” — also known as the heresy of <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/05/church-common-good.html">the church and the common good</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice the liberal view of Christianity is nothing more than the old
philosophy of value relativism, where everyone does what is right in
their own eyes and absolute authority doesn’t exist — that may be truth
for <em>you</em>, but not for <em>me</em> — and the Bible no longer holds the place
of authority.</p>
<p>Of course, truth is truth, whether you accept it or not, like it or not,
or believe it or not.</p>
<p>Progressive “Christians” absorb godless philosophy, agreeing with
Richard Dawkins as he said <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/06/more-dawkins-morality-no-absolutes.html">no absolutes exist</a>,
and morality comes from <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/12/problem-morality-where-does-it-come.html">popular opinion</a>,
not absolute truth. Liberals repackage godless philosophy (whether they
realize it or not), wrapping it with a thin candy shell of religion
hiding the toxic poison inside; it’s not wise for the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/04/jesus-was-republican-not-democrat.html">church to adopt techniques from someone admiring satan and rebellion</a>.</p>
<p>You must choose a position — will you choose the absolute truth of the
Bible, or will you minimize it to accept man’s godless philosophy of
value relativism (even if wrapped in religious terms) where the Bible
is minimized?</p>
<p>It’s time to decide what you believe and make a stand … because it’s
2:59AM and even those reducing the importance of the Bible realize a
split into traditional Christianity and liberal “Christianity” espousing
heresies like social justice, common good, and collective salvation will
soon be upon us.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common
salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you
that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once
delivered unto the saints. For there are certain men crept in
unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation,
ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and
denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ. (Jude 3–4)</p>
<p>But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there
shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable
heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon
themselves swift destruction. And many shall follow their pernicious
ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of. (2
Peter 2:1–2)</p>
</blockquote>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
