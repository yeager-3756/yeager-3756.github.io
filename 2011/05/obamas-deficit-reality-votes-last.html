  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>The <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/04/increasing-federal-deficit.html">increasing Federal deficit</a>
rises to the top issue these days as the government seeks to increase
the amount they spend on <em>your</em> credit card. The size of deficit
spending in the Obama administration is truly breathtaking (and not in a
good way). Unfortunately, they’ve been <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/09/its-deficit-stupid.html">lying to you about the deficit</a>
for years, as far back as the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/06/truth-lie-myth-surplus.html">myth of the surplus</a>
from the Clinton era.</p>
<p>Yet people call those pointing out the iceberg ahead fear-mongers (It’s
the end of the World!). Is the situation really that bad, and how much
<em>worse</em> has it gotten since 2008? A picture is worth a thousand words;
consider these two charts from the St. Louis Federal Reserve and you’ll
quickly understand just how much water the ship is taking on, while the
President and Congress argue about the color of the carpet instead of
plugging the hole.</p>
<h2>Inflation</h2>
<p>You’ve heard about <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/11/buzzword-alert-quantitative-easing.html">Quantitative Easing</a>,
which is just another name for printing money (inflation). In the real
world it’s theft — reaching into your pocket and taking a part of your
money through devaluation.</p>
<p>How much money has been printed recently, compared to history?</p>
<p><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/BASE"><img src="/images/blog/20110531-deficit-BASE.png" height="300" width="500" class="centered" /></a></p>
<p>That’s certainly stunning, and shows how much they’ve printed to cover
reckless spending and stimulus (exit question: are you better off now
than 2 years ago?).</p>
<p>Remember, rising prices are not the <em>cause</em> of inflation, they’re the
<em>result</em>. Inflation increases the amount of money in circulation, which
makes each dollar <em>less</em> valuable, so you have to use <em>more</em> of them.
It’s a Federal tax on your assets — without a vote — decreasing what you
can purchase.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you had a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T206_Honus_Wagner">Honus Wagner</a> baseball card.
There aren’t many around, which makes this particular card worth
millions to collectors who want it. Now, suppose somewhere in the dark
dusty recesses of the bubble gum factory a few boxes containing
thousands of Honus Wagner cards suddenly appear in pristine condition.</p>
<p>How much would your card now be worth? Not very much, because more of
them exist (they’ve been inflated, or quantitatively eased).</p>
<p>The money supply is no different. When the Fed prints money, it makes
what you’ve got worth less, thus you need <em>more</em> dollars to buy what you
used to. That’s inflation. The ugly truth of inflation remains
stunningly simple: theft of what you’ve earned. It’s the same as if
you’ve been robbed.</p>
<h2>Deficit Spending</h2>
<p>So how large of a disaster is the Federal budget? We heard all the noise
about how reckless President Bush was — remember that as you consider
the following graph:</p>
<p><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/FYFSD"><img src="/images/blog/20110531-deficit-FYFSD.png" height="300" width="500" class="centered" /></a></p>
<p>Notice those last two years? Mr. Obama takes reckless spending to new
heights (lows), as the last two years (the first two of his term)
graphically demonstrate.</p>
<p>It’s more interesting to consider <em>why</em> Obama spends so recklessly —
orders of magnitude worse than anything previously known on the planet.
Worse, under proposals now thrown around in Washington, it may take
<em>decades</em> to get back to the overspending levels known under President
Bush (as Obama has <em>tripled</em> the deficit).</p>
<p>Could we be seeing the
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/07/cloward-piven-strategy.html">Cloward-Piven</a>
strategy before our eyes? What else could explain such irresponsible
behavior of the administration? Will the crash and fireball be the
result of incompetence, stupidity, denial — or could it be the
deliberate and planned outcome?</p>
<h2>Idiots in Washington</h2>
<p>It’s past time to ask <em>why</em> the last few years have been such a train
wreck. If any hope exists of turning it around we can’t get hung up on
talk of $30 billion vs $60 billion in spending reductions, no, we need
to be in the range of $500 billion to $1,200 billion <em>per year</em> in
spending reductions. Spending may go up 20%, and then they act like
you’re cutting their throat for a puny 0.01% reduction.</p>
<p>It’s madness.</p>
<p>Only after a balanced budget exists can we begin to pay off the $14
Trillion in debt (or about $50,000 for every man, woman, and child in
the country), <em>and that assumes the reckless spending stops immediately</em>
(they don’t call ’em tax-and-spend for nothing).</p>
<p>So while the ship takes on water, the idiots in Washington argue over
what color carpet to put in the lounge. The bow of the ship has already
slipped beneath the waves, as the band plays on…</p>
<p>It’s madness.</p>
<p>We need new leadership, <em>fast</em> — people who understand the scope of the
problem, and will offer <em>real</em> solutions. Unfortunately, anyone brave
enough to admit to reality and propose solutions becomes savagely
attacked for political advantage, while the doomsday date becomes closer
and closer.</p>
<p>As John Loeffler says, reality votes last — and <em>always</em> wins.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
