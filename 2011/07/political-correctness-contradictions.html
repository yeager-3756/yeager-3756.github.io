  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>The politically correct crowd likes to boast about tolerance and
acceptance of others, but if you’ve ever disagreed with them you’ll
quickly discover how far their intolerance will go to defend their
anti-definition of tolerance. Sound bizarre? Are you asking yourself who
could be that illogical? Consider the following quote from a so-called
“tolerant” person:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/woman-seated-near-beck-at-movie-claims-innocence-but-what-does-twitter-tell-us/">
<p>We live our lives intolerant only of those who don’t tolerate&nbsp;…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice the problem? <strong>She claims to be tolerant — all while admitting
being intolerant</strong> (but <em>her</em> intolerance is justified, why it’s not
really intolerance at all as some people don’t deserve tolerance, and
she gets to choose who’s in the tolerated group and who’s in the
non-tolerated group). Of course, she missed the contradiction in her
position, a perfect case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">Cognitive Dissonance</a> — holding
conflicting ideas simultaneously (Orwell called it Doublethink). By her
own standard, <strong>she shouldn’t be tolerated because of her admitted
intolerance</strong> toward others.</p>
<p>In other words, she fails to live up to her own standard — a fact she
curiously fails to understand or notice.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/04/tolerance-redefined.html">Tolerance has been redefined</a>.
Most would agree tolerance means you have your view, I have mine, and we
can both discuss and try to convince the other but people are allowed to
have their view, and we should be respectful of differing views.
<strong>Tolerance does <em>not</em> mean you won’t hear opposing views</strong>, and you
won’t be asked to defend your ideas using logic and critical thinking.</p>
<p>The far-left “tolerant” person frequently labels anyone disagreeing with
them as using “hate-speech” — a strangely vague label meaning “anyone I
don’t like, or expresses ideas I don’t like”.</p>
<p>As this person points out, the far-left illogical crowd really means
<strong>tolerance is reserved only for those who agree with radical
ideology</strong>. If you don’t accept their opinion, those same “tolerant”
people are free to use whatever intolerant means they wish to squash
your voice … all in the name of “tolerance”.</p>
<p>It’s group-think at its best (worst).</p>
<p>If you’re interested in <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/10/exercise-logic.html">avoiding logical mistakes</a>,
study logic and critical thinking (something not taught in the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/01/failure-public-education.html">failed public schools</a>
much) — a good book to begin with is “Discerning Truth” by Dr. Jason
Lisle (ISBN 978-0890515945).</p>
<p>Remember, just because the herd you’re running with doesn’t notice
absurd statements and contradictions doesn’t give those ideas
credibility. As John Loeffler notes, <strong>the herd is almost always running
in the wrong direction</strong>.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Daniel-Darrin-Yeager/dp/0983111715/">The Book Of Daniel</a>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
