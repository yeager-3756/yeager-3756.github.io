  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>We’ve heard <em>much</em> about the Casey Anthony trial, but if you’ve read our
about page you know we’re not interested in news per se, but <em>how</em> that
news applies to <em>you</em>. In this incident, we’ll draw some conclusions
about the legal system — good or bad — instead of continuing other
discussion you’ll find elsewhere.</p>
<p>Some people don’t quite understand innocent until proven guilty; the
modern standard being innocent unless/until the media says so. There may
be people who believe if you’re arrested and tried, you’re guilty — a
not guilty verdict only being from some legal wrangling. In other words,
people on trial must be guilty, as the DA and others would <em>never</em>
prosecute an innocent person.</p>
<p>Say what you will about the Casey Anthony trial, some people felt there
was no evidence of <em>actual</em> murder:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://abcnews.go.com/US/casey-anthony-verdict-anthony-family-death-threats-wake/story?id=14004306&amp;page=2">
<p>“I didn’t hear any evidence at all that they have that Casey Anthony actually killed her child,” Murphy told the “Today” show on June 8. “There’s plenty that she lied. Plenty she was a bad mother. Plenty she probably participated in burying the body, maybe even covering up the crime. But I didn’t hear one thing that put Casey Anthony at the murder scene.” [Wendy Murphy, former prosecutor teaching at New England Law&nbsp;School]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without evidence of the act, how can you convict of murder? That’s not
reasonable doubt, that’s a complete and total lack of any evidence at
all. In other words, any unsubstantiated murder idea the prosecution
puts forth possess as much credibility as saying space aliens did it.</p>
<p>Yet some believe in conviction, <em>even if the prosecution presents no
evidence</em>.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://abcnews.go.com/US/casey_anthony_trial/casey-anthony-juror-sick-stomach-guilty-verdict/comments">
<p>Unless you have been living under a rock, you know the verdict in the Scott Peterson case. <b>Even with a lack of evidence the jury took the moral high road and convicted</b>&nbsp;him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If that doesn’t send a shiver down your spine, nothing will. With that
attitude, it’s only a short journey to a system in which anyone can be
guilty of anything, anytime someone wants.</p>
<p>Recall Robert Redford’s character in the movie “Legal Eagles” where a
similar situation came up regarding his defendant everyone believed had
overwhelming evidence against her?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>MR LOGAN</strong> [addressing the jury in his opening statement, after
laying out his theory]: You’re not buying this, are you? You’re not
listening to a word I’m saying. Guess what? I don’t blame you. After
listening to Mr. Blanchard lay out the prosecution’s evidence even I’m
convinced … Let’s save ourselves a lot of time. Let’s be honest. There
are better things we could be doing. Who thinks Chelsea Deardon is
guilty? [raises hand]</p>
<p><strong>PROSECUTOR</strong>: Objection your honor.</p>
<p><strong>MR. LOGAN</strong>: Don’t hold back. My hand is raised. I believe my client
murdered Victor Taft in cold blood. Isn’t everybody convinced? Who
agrees with me? [addressing a juror] You’re convinced, right? The
prosecution says she’s guilty. The jury says she’s guilty. Let’s save
the State of New York a lot of time and money and move directly
to sentencing.</p>
<p><strong>JUROR to Mr. Logan</strong>: Isn’t she entitled to a fair trial?</p>
<p><strong>MR. LOGAN</strong>: Let’s give her a fair trial and <em>then</em> convict her.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you start with a preconceived desired outcome, you’ve got a
kangaroo court — why bother with a trial at all? Just allow mob rule,
and to hell with the pesky ideas of evidence, proof, and due process.
Those ideas apply to <em>everyone</em> or they protect <em>nobody</em>. Innocent until
<em>proven</em> guilty isn’t just a slogan, it’s an idea which forms the
foundation of our legal protections.</p>
<p>If you can’t <em>prove</em> the method of actual death, you can’t even convict
of manslaughter. All the evidence after the death of disposing of the
body <em>do nothing to prove the actual crime of murder</em>. They may prove
lots of other things, but not the charges brought.</p>
<p>In any crime, it’s important the state <em>prove</em> their case, not with
flimsy evidence someone is a lousy person, but actual evidence the
person <em>committed the crime in question</em>. We’re on our way to a banana
republic when we abandon the concepts of evidence and due process for a
conviction — <em>even for people we don’t like</em>.</p>
<p>Yes, this means trial outcomes aren’t always what we want.</p>
<p>Proving the case with actual evidence remains a high bar for the state,
and that’s a good thing, even if we don’t always approve of the outcome
for unlikeable defendants.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
