  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Post-modern philosophy denies absolutes — reality isn’t absolute, only
what popular opinion or someone believes at the time. Think that’s
absurd? The current occupant of the White House believes firmly in
post-modern philosophy, admitting in a speech on the Senate floor
concerning the Supreme Court he holds firmly to post-modern philosophy.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r109:S22SE5-0015:" title="Congressional Record, 109th Congress">
<p>… In those circumstances, your decisions about whether affirmative action is an appropriate response to the history of discrimination in this country or whether a general right of privacy encompasses a more specific right of women to control their reproductive decisions or whether <b>the commerce clause empowers Congress to speak on those issues of broad national concern that may be only tangentially related to what is easily defined as interstate commerce</b>, whether a person who is disabled has the right to be accommodated so they can work alongside those who are nondisabled—in those difficult cases, <b>the critical ingredient is supplied by what is in the judge’s heart.</b> [emphasis added]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that <strong>the current President proposes issues of Constitutional law
should <em>not</em> be decided based on the law</strong>, but in difficult cases the
Supreme Court of the United States should not look to the Constitution,
but to “what is in the judge’s heart” — simply put, a denial of the
absolute rule of law, and a choice to follow post-modern thought — the
denial of absolutes.</p>
<p>Of course, <strong>what is in one judges heart may not be in another</strong>, thus
the law becomes vague and shifting — value relativism. If you think
that’s not a good way to decide court cases, you’re absolutely (pun
intended) correct.</p>
<p>Using this process the “right” to an abortion is “found” in the
Constitution. Of course, <strong>using such a vague and ever-changing process
means no law can ever mean anything</strong> — only what is in the judge’s
heart at the time he makes a ruling. It’s a perfect example of the
denial of absolute truth using post-modernism.</p>
<p>Of course, the problem arises when some people don’t like what’s in some
judges “heart”, and then search for judges not based on fairly applying
the law, but how they’ll avoid the law to do what a group or community
organizer wants. It’s for that reason so many nasty fights are now
fought over judgeship — because it’s no longer about judicial
qualifications, only if a person will twist the law to meet what a
specific lobbying group desires.</p>
<p>It’s precisely for this reason the fight over abortion rages. No right
to an abortion exists in the Constitution, so either the matter is left
to the states, or Congress should create legislation.</p>
<p>Of course, that doesn’t happen. Why? <strong>It’s easier for a group to sway
an activist post-modern judge than convince voters in 50 states</strong>.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama firmly comes down in the
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/11/post-modern-philosophy-church.html">post-modern</a>,
“living Constitution” no-absolutes-exist value-relativism camp where
words can be twisted to mean anything, thus they mean nothing.</p>
<p>If this abuse of the commerce clause is upheld, the Constitution will
have no real value, as once this precedent is set, it will be referred
to in “US Citizens forced to eat broccoli daily” and “when you can flush
your toiler” and other later judicial decisions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Well, Doctor, what have we got, a republic or a monarchy?” Benjamin
Franklin responds — “A republic … if you can keep it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s reality — <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/09/matrix-guide-christianity.html">deny reality at your peril</a>.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
