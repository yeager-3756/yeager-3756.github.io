  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>The “Freedom from Religion Foundation” attempt to force their views onto
everyone else crashes and burns in a spectacular fireball; the National
Day of Prayer began in the 1950’s (so it’s a recent effort by atheists
to squash it), and the law roughly reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The President shall issue each year a proclamation designating the
first Thursday in May as a National Day of Prayer on which the people
of the United States may turn to God in prayer and meditation at
churches, in groups, and as individuals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Freedom From Religion people didn’t like this, and sued the
President as they felt it established a religion (of course, they never
said <em>which</em> one, so it seems their point is quite vague, but we’ll
move on).</p>
<p>The court in rejecting their complaint provided a simple and obvious
reason: they weren’t injured by the proclamation, as the court ruled:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Section 119 imposes duties on the President alone. It does not require
any private person to do anything—or for that matter to take any
action in response to whatever the President proclaims. If anyone
suffers injury, therefore, that person is the President, who is
not complaining.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Smack! That’s going to leave a mark.</p>
<p>Later in the ruling, we see the <em>real</em> problem the atheists had:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Plaintiffs contend that they are injured because they feel excluded,
or made unwelcome…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So they sued because they’re sad — let’s all send them a Hallmark card.</p>
<p>Of course, they can pray and be included if they wish, but nobody
<em>forces</em> them (or anyone else) to participate if they do not wish to do
so, as the court noted “hurt feelings differ from legal injury”. Perhaps
the Foundation should review <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/04/first-amendment-separation-church-state.html">The First Amendment</a>
before filing another lawsuit.</p>
<p>Some groups attempt to rewrite history, forcing their views on everyone
in the country. If you don’t want to participate in the National Day of
Prayer, don’t. It’s no different when the President asks for people to
donate to the Red Cross after a disaster. If you don’t want to donate,
fine, but don’t throw a temper tantrum about it.</p>
<p>The country was founded on Christian principles as anyone reading
historical documents and/or court decisions immediately recognizes.
Atheists are certainly welcome, but aren’t welcome to change history
because of their fear of God. Perhaps the following will assist in
their research:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/united-states-christian-nation.html">Is the United States a Christian Nation?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/04/first-amendment-separation-church-state.html">The First Amendment</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/tag/a-christian-nation.html">Articles on A Christian Nation</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As George Washington said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WHEREAS it is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the providence of
Almighty God, to obey His will, to be grateful for His benefits, and
humbly to implore His protection and favor; and</p>
<p>WHEREAS both Houses of Congress have, by their joint committee,
requested me “to recommend to the people of the United States a day of
public thanksgiving and prayer, to be observed by acknowledging with
grateful hearts the many and signal favors of Almighty God, especially
by affording them an opportunity peaceably to establish a form of
government for their safety and happiness:”</p>
<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I do recommend and assign Thursday, the 26th day of
November next, to be devoted by the people of these States to the
service of that great and glorious Being who is the beneficent author
of all the good that was, that is, or that will be; that we may then
all unite in rendering unto Him our sincere and humble thanks for His
kind care and protection of the people of this country previous to
their becoming a nation; for the signal and manifold mercies and the
favorable interpositions of His providence in the course and
conclusion of the late war; for the great degree of tranquillity,
union, and plenty which we have since enjoyed…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Founders clearly didn’t have a problem with such things, and since
they’re the ones who wrote the Constitution, they should know what it
meant. The atheist assault on God is a <em>recent</em> invention, brought by
those seeking to change history (shall we call them history-deniers?).</p>
<p>As we’ve noted before:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course, since <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/01/atheism.html">atheism itself is illogical</a>,
we shouldn’t be surprised if atheists express a lack of critical
thinking skills and logic in other areas as well, as their
foundational dogma is as absurd as claiming the moon is made
of cheese.</p>
<p>If atheists what to begin a conversation about eliminating religion
from society to match their personal faith, that’s one thing. But
denying history only makes them look silly.</p>
</blockquote>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
