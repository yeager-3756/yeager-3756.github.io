  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Chuck Missler says never underestimate a person’s ability to
rationalize, or justify the unjustifiable, or attempt (poorly) to
reconcile contradictory beliefs.</p>
<p>Acceptability may not depend on some standard, but rather the subject of
the action. Double standards arrive due to an application of dialectic
thought, more commonly known as group-think. If the group thinks it’s
bad, it’s bad, and if good, it’s good, failing to consider absolute
standards of morality.</p>
<p>In other words, even among those calling themselves “Christians”,
critical thinking skills and logic frequently lack, instead following
the herd.</p>
<h3>A “Christian” Example</h3>
<p>Here’s an example from a site claiming to be Christian, as an author
laments about the lack of civility in politics. He wondered why those
who complain about attacks on President Obama failed to defend President
Bush when he was the victim of savage personal attacks.</p>
<p>Here’s where the rationalization comes in as a person commented on
the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re talking apples and oranges here. Many, perhaps most, of the people who hate Obama also hated Bill Clinton because, and only because, they were relatively liberal Democrats who were elected&nbsp;president.</p>
<p>Bush, OTOH, became president in the first place because of what some might call a dubious Supreme Court decision, pursued insane economic policies and engaged us in two wars …
<cite>http://blog.sojo.net/2010/12/29/the-inconsistency-for-the-call-to-civility/#comment-120760745</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To summarize the argument: when it happens to <em>my</em> guy, it’s bad, but
it’s okay if those things happen to someone I don’t like — it’s not the
action itself, but who it’s applied to determining right or wrong.</p>
<p>Notice the rationalization — one guy had unfavored policies, therefore
attacks against him were acceptable, while another guy had favored
policies, thus attacks were mean and undeserved. Also notice the
justification is based on <em>opinion</em>, not facts.</p>
<p>Classic value-relativism, as worldly philosophy becomes accepted by
people in the church.</p>
<h2>Situational Ethics</h2>
<p>That attitude leads to situational ethics, where determining right and
wrong depends on the situation. Murder is bad, but it’s worse if it’s
this group being murdered, or less bad (or even good) when it’s this
group being murdered.</p>
<p>In this case, the commenter actually attempts to defend the indefensible
(and logically absurd) — personal attacks on some politicians are
acceptable, others are completely wrong, showing partiality to some and
applying morality unfairly.</p>
<p>Sorry folks, that’s garbage, and leads to the obvious question: who gets
to decide the rules, and how will they determine who gets protection,
and who doesn’t? That’s the problem value relativism finds itself
trapped in, and unfortunately some Christians become ensnared in
humanistic philosophy, rather than the absolute of God’s Word.</p>
<h2>Absolutes</h2>
<p>Absolutes <em>do</em> exist. Right and wrong <em>do</em> exist. Don’t allow yourself
to accept the humanistic idea of situational ethics, where <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/12/problem-morality-where-does-it-come.html">morality isn’t
absolute</a>,
and remember Paul’s warning to Timothy to “do nothing by partiality”.</p>
<p>Right is right, wrong is wrong. If the subject of an action determines
your view of right and wrong, you’re showing partiality, and engaging in
value relativism.</p>
<p>The church needs to resist humanistic philosophy infiltrating the
church, such as <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">social justice</a>,
the emerging church, value relativism, and more. If you’re hearing
buzzwords and flavor-of-the-month ideas, it might just be worldly
philosophy repackaged with new vocabulary to fool Christians into
abandoning the absolutes of God’s Word.</p>
<h2>Action Plan</h2>
<p>If you’re interested in an easy to read primer on logic and how
frequently logical errors occur, we highly recommend “Discerning Truth”
by Jason Lisle (ISBN 978-0890515945). It’s a quick read and provides a
good introduction to logic.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
