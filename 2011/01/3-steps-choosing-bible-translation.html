  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>We find many articles on Bible translation express a similar idea: go to
a bookstore and read various translations and pick one you like. In
other words, they’re all roughly equivalent, and choosing one over the
other becomes personal preference.</p>
<p>Unfortunately that’s wrong as major differences exist, thus <strong>we need a
method</strong> to find those differences, and select a translation best
expressing the original author’s words.</p>

</div>
<h2>1. Find the Translator’s Methods</h2>
<p>Normally at the front of your Bible the translators include a preface.
Read it and you’ll find the background of the translators, how and why
they performed the translation, their statement of faith, and so on.</p>
<p>Hidden in those notes becomes the first issue: <strong>which text the
translators used</strong>, as two distinct lines exist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Textus Receptus</li>
<li>Westcott-Hort, UBS, and Nestle-Aland.</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, the Textus Receptus proves superior to the others, for
reasons why see our article on <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/01/which-bible-translation-best.html">Bible Translation</a>.</p>
<h2>2. Check for Missing or Changed Verses</h2>
<p>It might surprise you to learn <strong>some translations delete verses</strong>, or
remove words which change the meaning of passages.</p>
<ul>
<li>(Matthew 18:11 NKJV) For the Son of Man has come to save that which
was lost.</li>
<li>(Matthew 18:11 KJV) For the Son of man is come to save that which
was lost.</li>
<li>(Matthew 18:11 NIV) deleted</li>
</ul>
<p>Also Revelation 11:17:</p>
<ul>
<li>(Revelation 11:17 NKJV) saying: We give You thanks, O Lord God
Almighty, The One who is and who was and who is to come, Because You
have taken Your great power and reigned.</li>
<li>(Revelation 11:17 KJV) Saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God
Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast
taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned.</li>
<li>(Revelation 11:17 NIV) saying: We give thanks to you, Lord God
Almighty, the One who is and who was, because you have taken your
great power and have begun to reign</li>
</ul>
<p>Also note Matthew 25:13 (where a deletion turns the verse into
nonsense), Mark 2:17 and Acts 8:37.</p>
<p><strong>Westcott-Hort’s textual base deletes many verses</strong>; some of the modern
translations follow it closely (NIV), while others less (NASB).
Examining these verses reveals how much human editing the translators
feel God’s Word needed in the name of “scholarship”.</p>
<h2>3. Determine if it’s Literal or Paraphrase</h2>
<p><strong>All translations paraphrase to some extent</strong>, but some take a greater
license than others; 2 Timothy 2:15 provides clues to how literally the
translator viewed their job.</p>
<ul>
<li>KJV — Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that
needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</li>
<li>NIV — Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a
workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles
the word of truth</li>
</ul>
<p>“Rightly divide” translates the Greek orthotomeo — similar to a math
term orthogonal meaning a right angle, carrying the meaning of precision
and accuracy. In this case “correctly handles” isn’t too bad, but it’s
not as precise.</p>
<p>Instead of “Study” the NIV uses “Do your best” which changes the meaning
and waters down the devotion as study implies dedication, while just
doing your best can mean a lot less.</p>
<p>This one verse reveals volumes about how the translator views their job.
Is it to make a “user friendly” translation, or to accurately and
literally translate? Keep in mind a paraphrase isn’t <em>always</em> bad, but
you <em>do</em> need to know when the translator attempted to paraphrase.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Use these three steps to become familiar with how and why the
translators performed their task, and instead of “choosing what you
like” you’ll be on your way to understanding how and why various
translations came to be, and the bias of the translators. For a more
through study on the subject, have a look at our article on <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/01/which-bible-translation-best.html">Bible Translation</a>
and find out why <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2008/03/why-kjv-best-bible-translation.html">the KJV remains the best Bible</a>.</p>
<p>We recommended using either the KJV or NKJV for primary study, but keep
a New Living Translation handy for when a paraphrase might be helpful.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
