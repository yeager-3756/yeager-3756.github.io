  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>The social justice crowd frequently supports their position saying it’s
“Biblical”. What does that mean, and was the church in Acts socialist
and using redistribution, like social justice promoters want Christians
to advocate today?</p>
<p>Susan Brooks Thistlethwaite writes Christians should encourage the
government to follow the socialist model, as she wrote the early church
did. Of course, the question she ignored — if we should be like the
early church, was the early church socialist?</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/on-faith/post/its-not-class-warfare-its-christianity/2011/09/19/gIQAkoMxfK_blog.html" title="Washington Post">
<p>Part of the way we got here is by Christian conservatives ignoring a lot of what the Bible says on wealth and poverty, and being highly selective in what they call “biblical.” In all these reference to the “Bible,” the self-styled Christian capitalists don’t ever seem to recall that in the Book of Acts, the early disciples “shared all things in common.” As I wrote for On Faith, the early church is Glenn Beck’s worst nightmare because it was socialist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice she admits they <em>shared</em>, all the while agreeing with the social
justice crowd about <em>forced</em> redistribution. It’s a <strong>slight-of-hand
trick she and others hope you won’t notice</strong> as she talks of the Bible
on one hand, but attempts to apply it to something totally different,
and hopes nobody notices (sort of an inverse straw-man argument).</p>
<p>The church in Acts was <em>never</em> socialist. <strong>The “social justice”
socialist-church Thistlethwaite supports exists apart from the book of
Acts</strong> — it’s <em>not</em> Biblical. Sharing was voluntary, not forced; Peter
makes the point to Ananias (Acts five) his property (and money from any
sale) was his to do with as <em>he</em> wished. Ananias’ actions were <em>not</em>
forced (socialism), they were <em>voluntary</em> (charity).</p>
<p>The church in Acts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Affirmed private property rights.</li>
<li>Encouraged <em>voluntary</em> sharing (charity).</li>
<li>Didn’t forcefully confiscate property.</li>
<li>Didn’t lobby Rome to become socialist.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the social justice ideology:</p>
<ul>
<li>Denies rights (you don’t “need” or “deserve” it).</li>
<li>Claims <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/06/tea-party-charity-social-justice.html">charity is insufficient</a>.</li>
<li>Encourages forced seizing of private property.</li>
<li>Encourages lobbying for socialism.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those don’t exactly match, do they? Here’s a comment left on Sojourners
on an article titled “Why Christians Should be Biased”. The title of
course, tells you immediately they’re not in a Biblical position, but
we’ll move on.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://blog.sojo.net/2011/09/20/why-christians-should-be-biased/#comment-316042964" title="Sojourners">
… here in America hide these parts of the gospel by not preaching them and only take a stand on the fact that it’s not the government’s job to aid the poor. This even is unfortunately not biblical. It’s a lie <span class="sic">propigataed</span> by uninformed Christians.
</blockquote>
<p>First off, it’s not nice to call people liars — especially when they’re
easily demonstrated 100% correct (and it makes you look
foolish besides).</p>
<p>Could this person please identify where in the New Testament Jesus, Paul
or <em>any</em> apostle teaches Christians should lobby the government to force
redistribution instead of individual charity? They can’t <em>because it’s
not there</em>, and yet they claim it’s Biblical—without offering any
proof—and call those who know it’s not true liars.</p>
<p>Let’s consider what might have happened if an early disciple followed
the modern “social justice” forceful redistributive position.</p>
<p>The “social justice” apostle-organizer meets with a group of disciples,
and slowly rises to his feet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here’s what we’re going to do guys—Paul, stop that charity collection,
you’re wasting time—we’re going to start a massive lobbying effort,
we’ve hired the best and—Paul will you <em>please</em> sit down, we’re trying
to organize—we’ll convince Rome to forcefully confiscate possessions
of all the fat cats who don’t need it, and get them to redistribute
it. So get out there and lobby, lobby, lobby! We can do this! It’s
change! We’ll just take a small administrative fee to support our
effort and pay our consultants (enter Saul Alinsky, extreme
stage far-left)…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nope, nothing like that appears, and yet that’s what the heretical
“social justice” position promotes.</p>
<p>Of course, in our fictitious dramatic example, Paul would be next to
speak up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Um, once we get Rome to confiscate the possessions of the undeserving
fat cats, what will stop them from using it for purposes we don’t
intend it to, like abortion? What if Rome gives it to people who
should provide for themselves?, and the reply “We’re working on that —
don’t be such a conspiracy theorist”.</p>
<p>Did Jesus ever teach that you should pass <em>your</em> responsibility to
someone else? Why should we transfer what the church should do to a
godless government? Isn’t taking from others greedy and theft? (and a
violation of at least two commandments — “thou shalt not steal” and
“thou shalt not covet”).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those promoting the imaginary idea the Bible teaches “social justice”
(redistribution) are <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/09/matrix-guide-christianity.html">living in The Matrix</a> — they’re
comfortable in their imaginary world believing whatever they want to —
in spite of facts. Believing the fantasy social justice is Christian is
as reasonable as thinking the moon is made of cheese. Both are
<em>provably</em> false, and only accepted by people stubbornly refusing to
accepting facts and/or living in The Matrix.</p>
<p>Ask where the New Testament teaches Christians about forced
redistribution and you’ll be met with a deer-in-the-headlights look,
because <strong>they <em>know</em> what they’re peddling isn’t true</strong> — “social
justice” isn’t something Christians are taught. Ever.</p>
<p>Why they continue to peddle what they <em>know</em> to be false remains
a mystery.</p>
<p>True Christian charity is voluntary, while <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">social justice is a counterfeit
gospel</a>
with no Biblical support at all (Wallis’ claim social justice is at the
heart of the gospel is so absurd it’s stunning anyone falls for it);
it’s embarrassing (and wrong) when Wallis and Thistlethwaite try to
force the square peg of social justice and forced redistribution into
the round hole of Biblical charity.</p>
<p>If you want to be socialist, fine. If you want to promote socialist
policies like redistribution, okay. If you want to lobby the government
to become Marxist, you’re free to do so (at least until you get your
way, and then you’ll find you’re not free anymore. Socialists are free
to do as they want <em>unless they get what they want</em>, a fact they likely
miss the irony of).</p>
<p>But don’t even <em>think</em> socialist policies are Christian, or exampled in
the New Testament, because they’re not.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
