<p>Perhaps you’ve seen our tag line “Because it’s 2:59AM” and wondered
where it came from; it stems from a political ad Hillary Clinton used in
her bid for the Presidency.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-502163_162-3891676-502163.html" title="CBS News">
<p>It’s 3AM and your children are safe and asleep. But there’s a phone in the White House and it’s ringing. Something’s happening in the world. Your vote will decide who answers that call. Whether it’s someone who already knows the world’s leaders, knows the military, someone tested and ready to lead in a dangerous world.</p>
<p>It’s 3AM and your children are safe and asleep — who do you want answering the phone?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hillary noted Obama had no real experience at all (while she did), and
in the middle of the night you don’t have advisers to lean on—you’ve got
what you’ve got—so the person answering the White House phone <em>must</em>
have experience. Hillary’s point was she <em>did</em> have executive experience
and could handle emergency events by herself, while Obama had no
executive experience — a point he conceded when he replied his
experience amounted to running a campaign.</p>
<p>So what does a political ad have to do with your Christian life?</p>
<p>For the Christian, <em>you</em> will be answering the phone, not your pastor,
friends or anyone else. <strong>Are <em>you</em> prepared at 3AM</strong> when nobody is
around? At 3AM, you’ve got what you’ve got. If you’re depending on the
availability of your pastor, friends, or even your husband or wife, you
could be in for a <em>big</em> surprise when crunch time arrives.</p>
<p>Yet you feel <em>somethings</em> wrong with the world and what you’re hearing —
from politicians, friends, and yes, even pastors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You’re here because you know something. What you know you can’t
explain, but you feel it. You’ve felt it your entire life, that
there’s something wrong with the world. You don’t know what it is, but
it’s there… — Morpheus</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, you’re in The Matrix — an artificial system built for the sole
purpose to deceive you and hide the real world. In order to explain what
you’re feeling, you must break out of The Matrix.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Morpheus: The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in
this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when
you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work …
when you go to church … when you pay your taxes. It is the world that
has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.</p>
<p>Neo: What truth?</p>
<p>Morpheus: That you are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else you were born
into bondage. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch…</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Satan <em>wants</em> you to be comfortable in The Matrix</strong>, trapped in a
church spending time on heresies instead of truth, teaching pot lucks
instead of the Bible, sermonizing instead of line-by-line teaching, and
feeling good instead of practical application of God’s Word. Instead of
being right, the church feels good about being wrong.</p>
<p>The Matrix also involves your <em>personal</em> life — the idea the Christian
life is easy, and God makes life fun, with a Lexus, a pony … and
ice cream!</p>
<p>Sorry folks, that’s the system deceiving you <em>and</em> the church.</p>
<p>In the end, <strong>Christians fail because they’re unprepared to face the
challenges awaiting them</strong> — too many Christians live in The Matrix,
having no concept of reality, replacing the sound doctrine of the Bible
with The Matrix system of deception. Sadly, those living in The Matrix
(including some “pastors”) fail to recognize the state they’re in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you’re
inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers,
lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to
save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system
and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these
people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured,
so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect
it. — Morpheus</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many Christians exist comfortably in their own Matrix — Hell doesn’t
really exist so everyone is saved (Universal Salvation), it’s the
church’s job to do good works (the heresy of Social Justice), the Bible
must be reinterpreted for today (denying inerrancy), Satan doesn’t
really exist (try opposing him for a while), and more.</p>
<p>Those are The Matrix (or as Yoda would say “the dark side are these”) —
the system you’re up against.</p>
<p>Just like the movie, <strong>many people living in The Matrix don’t want to
know the truth</strong>, and will fight to protect a false reality.</p>
<p>Just like Neo, you’ve got a choice to make.</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop reading, ignore reality and believe whatever you want to.</li>
<li>Study what’s really going on, and see how deep the rabbit-hole goes.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re in the first group, stop reading right now and return to “I
Love Lucy” reruns. Seriously. You’ll be more comfortable (if in
bondage), and you won’t bother the rest of us preferring to live
in reality.</p>
<p>It may be harsh, but heed the words of Samuel Adams, as they have a
similar meaning to Christians and The Matrix.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you love wealth greater than liberty, the tranquility of servitude
greater than the animating contest for freedom, go home from us in
peace. We seek not your counsel, nor your arms. Crouch down and lick
the hand that feeds you; May your chains set lightly upon you, and may
posterity forget that you were our countrymen. — Samuel Adams</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those wishing to live in The Matrix, so be it; we’re going to move
on and assume:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re not living in The Matrix.</li>
<li>You want to go beyond the basics.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/01/atheism.html">absurdities of atheism</a>,
the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2008/05/evolution-science.html">lack of science in evolution</a>,
the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">heresy of false gospels</a>,
and so on — those are <em>beginner</em> subjects. As Paul said, it’s time to
move beyond the milk and on to the meat — black-belt Christianity.</p>
<p>Don’t worry if you haven’t mastered those subjects, we (and others) have
written much on them and you can pick them up as we go along. <strong>As long
as you’re willing to logically examine</strong> what frequently has been sold
unquestionably as true (and turns out to be completely false) you’ll be
fine. Join us as we together explore the system and try to save others.</p>
<p>But know this if you chose number two — many despicable, vile, and nasty
attacks will come from people claiming to be “Christians” still trapped
by a system designed to deceive them. Those are the people you’re trying
to save, as long as they’re in The Matrix they’re ineffective as they’re
trapped by a system designed to deceive them — a system which includes
some claiming to be pastors.</p>
<p>For some of you, that’s a hard point to accept.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m trying to free your mind, Neo. But I can only show you the door.
You’re the one that has to walk through it. — Morpheus</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s just examine <em>one</em> example of a pastor who really doesn’t believe
anything of Christianity.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.khouse.org/enews_article/2008/1316/" title="KHouse">
<p>The minister at Toronto’s West Hill United Church, Rev. Gretta Vosper, does not teach her congregation to recite the Apostle’s Creed. She does not believe that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit or born of a virgin. She does not believe that Jesus rose again from the dead or ascended into heaven… or most of the basic tenets of Biblical Christianity. In fact, when her congregation sings famous hymns, the references to Christ and God are removed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just because someone calls themselves a Christian doesn’t make it so.
The question you must ask these people — how much of Christianity can
you reject and still claim to be a Christian? Ask <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/01/atheist-understanding-gospel-surpasses-pastors.html">atheist Christopher Hitchens</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would say that if you don’t believe that Jesus of Nazareth was the
Christ and Messiah, and that he rose again from the dead and by his
sacrifice our sins are forgiven, you’re really not in any meaningful
sense a Christian.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Truth comes from an atheist—having a better understanding of Christian
theology—rather than a “pastor”. Those are the people inhabiting The
Matrix, the system you’re up against.</p>
<p>Yes, Virgina, The Matrix is real.</p>
<p>Be prepared to cast aside many of the things you’ve been taught which
turn out to be lies. No, we’re not conspiracy theorists; <strong>we’re
interested in what is <em>true</em>, not what is <em>popular</em> or <em>trendy</em>.</strong>
People trapped by The Matrix fill the political, science, and popular
opinion arenas, and can’t escape the virtual reality they live in. It’s
your responsibility to be different.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve broken out of the system, do you want to help others?
Obviously that’s the right thing to do, as many of your brothers and
sisters have no idea the system they’re living in, and require your help
to break free from their bondage to join us in the real world.</p>
<p>As a Christian <em>you</em> must be prepared. Too many <strong>lazy Christians exist
with no practical experience</strong> or knowledge, and when that 3AM phone
call comes in to their own house they fail to respond.</p>
<p>In other words, it’s not just enough to <em>know</em> what reality is—even Neo
required training—you’ve got to know <em>how to use what you know</em>, a skill
not widely disseminated. Some Christians may <em>know</em> what’s true, they
may even understand what the armor of God is, but they fail to train and
prepare for the inevitable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Neo, sooner or later you’re going to realize just as I did that
there’s a difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
— Morpheus</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>At 3AM, you’ve got what you’ve got</strong>. Even once you escape The Matrix,
that knowledge alone isn’t sufficient. In order to be effective, you
must know how to use what you know.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You
take the blue pill — the story ends, you wake up in your bed and
believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill — you stay
in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes. — Morpheus</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what kind of Christian do you want to be? A prepared, well-equipped,
well-trained veteran capable of rescuing your fellow Christians out of
the sausage grinder, or a deluded Christian living in The Matrix, where
everything tastes like chicken?</p>
<p>It’s your choice. If you want to engage and make a difference, join our
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/page/newsletter.html">mailing list</a> as we explore how
deep the rabbit-hole goes, learn from the best <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/09/5-bible-commentators-you-should-be-listening.html">Bible Commentators</a>,
and understand <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/08/what-you-need-know-about-free-lunch.html">no free lunch exists</a>
— you’ll be required to expend considerable effort, and at times your
efforts will be tiring, and even discouraging.</p>
<p>You need a <strong>black-belt in Christianity</strong> — something too many
Christians leave to their pastor. It’s <strong>time to put the uniform on and
get (back) in the game</strong>. Sure, training isn’t a lot of fun, but when
you find yourself in the proverbial back-alley at 3AM, you’ve got what
you’ve got, and we’re tired of seeing Christians (metaphorically) not
only failing to bring a knife to a gun-fight, but lacking any tools
at all.</p>
<p>That <em>must</em> change. Sure, it’s a new approach, but insanity is doing the
same thing over and over yet expecting a different result.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Neo, nobody has ever done this before. (Trinity)</p>
<p>That’s why it’s going to work. (Neo)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You’ve got a choice to make — right now, today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop reading and return to a phony and deceptive “reality” and
believe whatever you want to. You’ll be comforted in bondage and
slavery, but never truly be effective.</li>
<li>Stay with us in Wonderland and together we’ll explore how deep the
rabbit-hole goes (in your Christian life, heresies, politics,
science, and more), because <strong>at 3AM, you’ve got what you’ve got</strong> …
and it’s 2:59AM.</li>
</ul>
<p>As John Loeffler says, <strong>your failure to be informed does not make me a
wacko</strong>, and reality <em>always</em> votes last.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember… all I’m offering is the truth. Nothing more. — Morpheus</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
