  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>In many cases extreme views prove problematic. In regards to gender
roles (men and women and their function in the church), two ideas
frequently pop up. Unfortunately, both are quite wrong.</p>
<ol>
<li>Women are inferior, can’t do anything, and shouldn’t be allowed to.</li>
<li>Men and women are interchangeable, and women can do anything
men can.</li>
</ol>
<p>The second idea is obviously false (as any biology course will teach
you). <strong>Men and women have different strengths, weaknesses, and
suitability for certain tasks</strong>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately that truth sometimes leads to the first idea — women are
inferior because they posses different traits from men.</p>
<p>Both positions are wrong.</p>
<h2>An Extreme Example of the Problem</h2>
<p>Here’s an example of the politically correct
everyone-is-interchangeable idea.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.redletterchristians.org/does-god-really-prefer-men/">
<p>Why can women only be Sunday School teachers and not preachers in many denominations? Is there some weakness, some character flaw that handicaps a female child from the day she is born, making her incapable of strong and responsible leadership in the Body of Christ? Does the Bible proclaim that women, based on their gender alone, are to be under the subordination and control of men? We answer with a resounding,&nbsp;“No!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This argument is known as a straw-man, meaning proposing an idea which
isn’t really the position of the person (in this case, the Bible),
defeating it, and then hoping by association the more actual truth of
the person (in this case, the Bible) will be associated with the
straw-man argument.</p>
<p>It’s an error in logic, as <strong>this group rails against a position
appearing nowhere in the Bible</strong>.</p>
<h2>The Problem’s Origin</h2>
<p>Perhaps the reason this person arrived at such a theologically
wrong position:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.redletterchristians.org/does-god-really-prefer-men/">
<p>It’s frustrating enough for a Christian woman to be told from the pulpit that she is somehow inferior to men in the eyes of&nbsp;God</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’d go beyond frustrating — <em>it’s plain wrong</em>, and that pastor should
consider James 3:1.</p>
<p>They’ve been victims of horrendously wrong instruction, as <strong>the Bible
never says women are inferior</strong>, and a pastor claiming so won’t make it
true. But the solution is <em>not</em> to jump to the other extreme, rather
it’s to find out what the correct ideas are.</p>
<h3>Organization of the church</h3>
<p>Leadership is military order — nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p>Any large entity (like the church) <em>must</em> have some structure to it.
Failing to understand that leads to a symphony of errors. In this case,
understanding how the military organizes sheds insight into how the
church should function.</p>
<h4>The “Rule of Threes”</h4>
<p>Much can be learned from the Marines and how they’re organized.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fire Team — Consisting of a rifleman (M16), grenadier (M203),
machine gunner (M249).</li>
<li>Squad — three fire teams.</li>
<li>Platoon — three squads.</li>
<li>Company — three platoons.</li>
<li>Battalion — three companies.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fire team forms the smallest unit. Notice each man carries different
weaponry for different tactical situations. Yet the machine gunner with
the M249 can’t complain he’s not carrying the M203 … or the unit is
dysfunctional and can’t function.</p>
<p>It’s not superiority or inferiority, simply different tactical uses.</p>
<h3>The Secret: “Rule of Threes” and the Church</h3>
<p>Applying the previous example to the church, the family represents the
Fire Team.</p>
<p>Moving up the ladder, a few families form a home fellowship, much like
in Acts. Once again, someone must lead the group, and Paul lays out to
Timothy the requirements for a leader, but the leader does not have
superiority over others simply because he’s the leader.</p>
<p>A few of those fellowships come together to form a local church, with a
pastor in leadership. If you’ve been in a church where the pastor isn’t
really in charge, you realize how awful it can be. The pastor must be in
charge or the unit (church) becomes dysfunctional.</p>
<p>The elders aren’t inferior to the pastor, even though the pastor leads
the fellowship. Again, if you’ve been in a church where the pastor and
elders aren’t functioning correctly, you <em>know</em> how critical correct
leadership is.</p>
<p>I’ve yet to see a group of elders complain they’re inferior to the
pastor because he’s in charge and they’re not. Remember, attempting to
usurp God-given authority must be called for what it is — rebellion (a
situation getting a certain angel into quite a bit of trouble, if
we recall).</p>
<p>City churches bond together to form regions (or denominations), and
eventually above all is Christ.</p>
<h4>Organization, not Superiority</h4>
<p>Looking at it in a military fashion, it’s obvious leaders aren’t
superior; <strong>the issue isn’t superiority or inferiority, but military
leadership</strong>.</p>
<p>Those claiming men and women are interchangeable lack understanding of
(or willfully deny) organizational roles, the military structure of the
church, and Paul’s clear and obvious instruction.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you’re on either extreme (women are stupid, inferior, and weak <em>OR</em>
women and men are interchangeable) understand this: you’re flat-out
wrong, and that’s not what the Bible teaches. Jumping from one incorrect
extreme to another only trades one set of errors for another. You need
to <strong>stop the pendulum swinging from one extreme, and stop it in the
middle</strong> with a reasonable, balanced approach.</p>
<p>It’s tragic these false extremes continue in the church. Perhaps if
people understood <strong>the church organizes as a military organization</strong> —
looking at the example of the Marines — these horrible mistakes would
fade away.</p>
<p><strong>Men and women are uniquely qualified and suited for different roles</strong>
— you must understand <em>both</em> parts of that thought or you’ll end up in
an area the Bible fails to support.</p>
<p>Solving gender issues in the church isn’t a secret, just common sense.
It’s leadership, not superiority.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
