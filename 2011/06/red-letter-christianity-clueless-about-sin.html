  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Another wacky idea blowing through the church is so-called “Red Letter
Christianity”. Many of these movements blow through, distract many, and
then fade away as they desire to redefine God’s Word into something
“seeker friendly” for reasons of <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">social justice</a>,
or other (bad) ideas.</p>
<p>This week’s lesson comes as a founder of one group (Red-Letter
Christianity) Mr. Campolo (mis/re)defines sin, as he admits the group
<a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/Christianity/2006/02/Whats-A-Red-Letter-Christian.aspx">Red-Letter “Christianity” is a political movement</a>
— what he calls “progressive evangelicals”.</p>
<p>Although <strong>radical groups might use the same terminology as traditional
Christianity</strong>, they redefine terms to fit their political views; Mr.
Campolo wrote on the Huffington Post “What differentiates Red Letter
Christians from other Christians is our passionate commitment to social
justice — hence, our intense involvement in politics”.</p>
<p>We’ve written before on the <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">social justice</a>
movement, which exists as a far-left progressive political movement
rather than a God-centered religious one. So in the redefinition game,
<strong>what does the progressive liberal Red-Letter “Christian” mean by
sin</strong>? Allow Mr. Campolo to provide his definition, and see if it agrees
with what you’ve read in the Bible.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.redletterchristians.org/what-do-you-mean-by-sin/">
<p>From time to time, I have been asked in the academic classrooms where I have taught to define what I mean by sin.  I always respond by saying, “Sin is what diminishes the humanity of another person and of the&nbsp;self.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ll skip a detailed analysis of the passage and simply notice the
definition coming from <strong>Red-Letter “Christianity” has no reference to
God at all</strong> — an essentially atheist religion devoid of God (or truth).</p>
<p>You must remember when you use the word “sin”, and Mr. Campolo and
associated progressive political “Christians” do, <strong>you’re not talking
about the same thing, even if using the same word</strong>. Let that point sink
in, because it’s critical to understand. The first thing you have to do
when talking to a radical liberal progressive is <strong>get them to define
terms</strong>, as you’ll quickly find out they’ve redefined terms to suit
their ideology.</p>
<p>Suppose you told someone they were living contrary to God’s law
(adultery, drunkenness, etc). <strong>According to Red-Letter Christianity
speaking the truth is sin</strong>, as it had the possibility to make the
person feel sad. Boo-hoo-hoo. Send a Hallmark card.</p>
<p>What a load of stinking manure. Red-letter Christianity — another
non-biblical ideology (wrapped with a thin candy shell of religious
terms hiding it’s radical political ideology) which should be thrown on
the trash heap.</p>
<p>Remember David when he murdered one of his men? What did he say to God
in Psalm 51 — “Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this
evil in thy sight”. No mention of “dehumanizing”, the offense is
<em>always</em> against God.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Campolo’s ideas remove God</strong> from the equation, reducing sin to
whatever <em>you</em> want it to be — it’s not constant, but whatever
“diminishes the humanity” of a person. Not only is God not involved, but
neither is <em>truth</em>. According to Mr. Campolo’s definition of sin, if
what you say is true, but it bums someone out, that’s sin on your part.</p>
<p><strong>Sin is against God</strong>, period. It’s not about dehumanizing another
person or yourself. Those may be <em>results</em> of sin, but they’re most
definitely <em>not</em> the definition of sin. At best Mr. Camplo’s
redefinition confuses the definition of sin with the results of sin, at
worst Red-Letter Christianity’s version creates a heretical designer
religion centered around man, instead of God.</p>
<p>Where is the absolute inerrant Word of God? Nowhere to be found — only
whatever <em>man</em> decides is sin. Classic value relativism, and the removal
of God from Red Letter “Christianity” — reducing Christianity to a
man-centered philosophy which changes day to day.</p>
<p>Don’t fall for the brightly colored thin candy shell of religious
terminology, hiding the deadly poison of heresy inside.</p>
<p><strong>You’re required to take a stand</strong> on what you believe. Is it the
Bible? Or some strange shifting man-based radical philosophy (Red-letter
Christianity, <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">social justice</a>,
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/03/coming-church-division.html">collective salvation</a>,
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/05/church-common-good.html">common good</a>,
etc) somebody tells you to accept — a religion void of reference to God
or truth?</p>
<p>Because it’s 2:59AM.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
