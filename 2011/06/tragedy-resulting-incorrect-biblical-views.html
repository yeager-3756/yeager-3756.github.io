  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>It’s truly sad when someone receives improper teaching on the Bible, and
rejects God because of it. Just as bad are some groups who desire to
capitalize on such situations to promote their own heresies.</p>
<p>First, the situation of a woman who received some really off-the-wall
instruction on her place in Christianity:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.redletterchristians.org/is-womens-leadership-in-the-church-a-primary-issue/">
<p>I had heard the word of God, and I felt moved by much of it …. However, I was held back from this because I was told … Eve [was] really responsible for all sin in the world, and not Adam, even though she didn’t force him to eat the forbidden fruit … I was to be silent in church and women could not hold a position of responsibility. It was as if God had already decided that because I am female there was nothing [God] cared to hear me say. And worst of all was what was to happen if I were to marry. I would become a slave to my husband, obeying his word as if it were the word of God … I left church behind and my faith in the Lord with it. I couldn’t reconcile being part of a religion that had labeled me as inferior from&nbsp;birth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ll dissect this in two points, first, giving the proper Biblical
view, and second, a warning for those seeking to use events like this to
promote their own political ideology, instead of comforting those
affected by such incorrect ideas.</p>
<h2>The Correct View</h2>
<p>Let’s examine her thoughts one line at a time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eve [was] really responsible for all sin in the world, and not Adam</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even a quick reading of the Bible proves that false. It’s true Eve
sinned first, but throughout the remainder of the Bible, who bears
responsibility for it? Adam.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was to be silent in church</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ve covered this before, so we’ll just quote our book “The
Troubled Church”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the service women asked questions by shouting across the room
to their husbands. Paul reminds them of proper order; if a lady had a
question, don’t interrupt the service, wait until they arrived home.
In the context of previous verses, all must be in order and not
confusion — it’s not a prohibition of women speaking in church as Paul
already spoke of women praying and prophesying in chapter 11. Those
seeking to apply this verse to a global ban haven’t done their
homework.<br />
<cite>The Troubled Church, page 154</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So hopefully Paul’s meaning has become clear, if you want a detailed
commentary on all of 1 Corinthians, you can order “The Troubled Church”
from
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Troubled-Church-Darrin-Yeager/dp/0983111707/">amazon</a>
or other bookstore.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>women could not hold a position of responsibility</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where does the Bible say that? It doesn’t. Paul <em>does</em> speak to Timothy
“I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man, but
to be in silence.” We’ve already dealt with the silence part; the first
part has been understood for centuries to mean <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/07/biblical-roles-men-women.html">Paul did not allow women to be
pastors</a>
— that single role being reserved for men.</p>
<p>Those who wish to expand what Paul said into a total prohibition on
women serving are just as wrong as those discarding what Paul said
because it doesn’t fit their radical ideology of only parts of the Bible
applying today.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was as if God had already decided that because I am female there
was nothing [God] cared to hear me say.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s her conclusion from her misunderstandings, but note the Bible
says no such thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would become a slave to my husband</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once again, the Bible never says that, it’s a result of
faulty assumptions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I couldn’t reconcile being part of a religion that had labeled me as
inferior from birth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can’t blame her for that conclusion, but since the Bible and
Christianity <em>never</em> calls her inferior, she’s basing her rejection on
complete misunderstandings, perhaps from faulty teachers; we’ve seen
people spend page after page trying to justify something the plain sense
of the text contradicts.</p>
<p>Is the obvious meaning of the text incorrect, or pages of “scholarship”?
Let the reader decide for themselves, but don’t be swayed simply because
someone with a title behind their name writes volumes attempting to
justify the unjustifiable (the idea only part of the Bible applies — and
they can tell you which parts apply, and which parts you can ignore).</p>
<h2>Those Lurking to Take Advantage</h2>
<p>Much improper teaching exists (always has, always will), the danger
comes as some groups (social justice, red letter “Christians”, liberal,
progressive, etc) use tragic situations to further their own radical
non-Biblical agenda, instead of simply proclaiming the obvious truth of
the Word.</p>
<p>Groups preying on lousy situations such as the one this woman found
herself in should be met by everyone as false and evil — those
“Christians” are no better (and perhaps worse) than a cultist who twists
the Bible to make himself the guru standing between you and God.</p>
<p>When the plain sense of the text makes sense (and is obvious), don’t
allow “scholars” or other people pushing their agenda to convince you
the clear and obvious meaning of the text isn’t correct.</p>
<p>After all, why would God instruct Paul to write in such a way as to not
only obscure and hide the truth, but make the clear and obvious
meaning wrong?</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
