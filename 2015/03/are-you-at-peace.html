  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>Riots. Government corruption. Political instability. Massive government
debt. Wars. Rumors of wars. End times.</p>
<p>Much to be uneasy about, for sure.</p>
<p>Yet should we be? What happened to the peace that passes understanding?</p>
<p>Someone approached me this week wondering if a certain political figure
might be the anti-Christ.</p>
<p>I have no idea, yet the search consumes many people.</p>
<p>The real problem isn’t who the anti-Christ turns out to be (it’s not
Bill Gates, Kissinger, or Barney the Purple Dinosaur) — the church will
be gone before the guy is revealed.</p>
<p>No, it’s the anticipation, it’s worrying about how bad life on planet
earth is going to get. If you read the news at all, it’s going to get a
lot worse, that’s for sure.</p>
<p>Studying Bible prophecy, we know the end point “B.” And we know we’re at
“A” now.</p>
<p>However, knowing how we get from “A” to “B” we <em>don’t</em> know. We like to
infer a direction, but when it doesn’t work out that way, we panic.</p>
<p>The disciples were caught in exactly that problem more than once.</p>
<p>When Jesus said “let’s go to the other side of the lake” they added a
bit to what He said. Jesus said “let’s go to the other side,” while they
heard “let’s <em>cruise</em> to the other side.”</p>
<p>Thus, when events didn’t exactly work out the way they thought, they
encountered quite a bit of stress. Their peace departed.</p>
<p>So bad was their perceived predicament, they woke Jesus up screaming
Master, we’re dying out here! Don’t you care?</p>
<p>Jesus quieted the storm, and rebuked them for their lack of faith. What
faith?</p>
<p>Not faith in who He was — by waking Him up they <em>knew</em> who He was.</p>
<p>No, the faith they lacked was simply believing what He said. He said
we’re going to the other side, without providing details of the trip.</p>
<p>We suffer the same problem. We know end times. We know prophecy. We know
where we’re at now.</p>
<p>But <em>how</em> we get from “A” to “B” hasn’t been revealed to us, and just
like the disciples on the boat that day, we scream and fuss, Lord, don’t
you CARE?</p>
<p>Had they remained focused on His words, instead of worrying about how,
they would have remained at peace.</p>
<p>The problem with attempting to identify the anti-Christ isn’t the
impossibility of doing it. Rather, it’s simply a time-waster.</p>
<p>Psalm 90 asks the Lord to teach us to number our days. You may have a
few, or many — you don’t know.</p>
<p>It’s not the <em>quantity</em> you should be worried about, it’s the <em>quality</em>.</p>
<p>One enemy tactic hasn’t changed much, it involves getting you distracted
from what’s <em>really</em> important, and wasting away your hours.</p>
<p>And looking to figure out who the anti-Christ just about tops the list
of time-wasters (well, that and Facebook. I haven’t heard of anyone on
their deathbed list their regrets with one of them being “Gee, I wish I
had Facebooked more”)</p>

<p>The more you do that, and the less time spent on worthless pursuits, the
more at peace you’ll become.</p>
<p>Facebook will still be there, I promise.</p>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
