  <div class="entry-content">  
  
<p>I’ve received complaints when calling out heresies like <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/08/social-justice-counterfeit-christian-gospel.html">social justice</a>
— that of replacing the gospel with alternatives, a strange idea since
Paul explicitly defined the Gospel.</p>
<p>Just because someone calls themselves a Christian means nothing. How
much can you deny of Christianity before it’s no longer Christian? In
other words, what <em>are</em> the foundations of Christianity?</p>
<p>It may shock you to discover so-called pastors who <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/11/the-bizarreness-of-the-big-tent.html">deny the existence of
God</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, a coming church split will soon be upon us, between those holding
traditional Christianity, and those accepting everything and anything,
and thus nothing.</p>
<p>One popular buzzword is “progressive” Christianity. What do they
believe, and is it Christian?</p>
<blockquote cite='http://progressivechristianity.org/resources/youre-not-a-real-progressive-christian/'>
<p>For example,  I don’t personally subscribe to the likelihood of a physical resurrection, or uniquely divine incarnation of Jesus, or that “Yahweh” is God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can this be related at all to Christianity? Not even close. No physical
resurrection? Then Jesus is a liar.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself; handle me, and see;
for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. (Luke 24:39 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Flesh and bones sounds pretty physical to me.</p>
<p>Yes, Jesus was physically resurrected, unless He lied. Denying it means
the Bible is in error and contains mistakes. Worse yet, it actively
attempts to deceive you, since it claims to be error free, and yet
contains false statements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for
doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
righteousness. (2 Timothy 3:16 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>False statements, lies, and deception isn’t profitable, so if liberals
are to be believed Paul was wrong when writing to Timothy.</p>
<p>Are the liberals right, or the apostle Paul?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To me the Bible is an interesting historical compilation of stories
with some good morality, but it’s not “God’s word” or anything like that. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is <em>exactly</em> what progressives argue for — the Bible contains
errors and myths, and we must de-mythologize it. Of course, you’re left
with several questions progressives never answer.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Who</em> gets to decide what is and isn’t God’s Word?</li>
<li><em>What</em> method will they use?</li>
<li><em>Why</em> is their method superior to anyone elses?</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll never get answers to those questions. Liberals don’t want to talk
about it, because ultimately the answer is simple: Liberals simply don’t
want to believe the Bible is the Word of God.</p>
<p>In the end liberal theology is more about living the way people want to,
in <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/10/tactics-rebellion.html">open rebellion against God</a>, as
Walter Martin called it <a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/06/the-cult-of-liberal-theology.html">the cult of liberal theology</a>
(you can get the message from his web site).</p>
<p>If you don’t stand for something, you’ll fall for anything as
<a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/11/post-modern-philosophy-church.html">post-modern
philosophy</a>
infests the church, denying truth exists.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So while some advocate for a “big tent,” I advocate for a “HUGE tent.”
 By honoring a “HUGE Christian tent” we can have a large and caring
community who are primarily concerned with being open, accepting, and
effective at helping the world and its inhabitants to thrive now and
into the future. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, they’ve forgotten (or ignored) the words of Jesus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enter ye in at the strait gate; for wide is the gate, and broad is the
way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in
therein. Because straight is the gate, and narrow is the way, which
leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. (Matthew 7:13–14 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’re entering a big tent through a wide gate with many people in
it, according to Jesus you’re in the wrong tent.</p>
<p>In the next verse, Jesus warns false prophets <em>will</em> be in the church.
Remember the tares and the wheat? Imposters are (almost) impossible to
detect.</p>
<p>Progressive “Christianity” theology is a tare among the wheat.</p>
<p>How do you know? Inspect the fruit — does the doctrine try to move you
away from the Gospel? Does it tell you the Bible isn’t really God’s
Word?</p>
<p>Ultimately deception will become so bad if possible even the elect will
buy it. Who won’t? Anyone knowing the Word of God. Those can spot the
imposter.</p>
<p>No doubt can exist liberal and progressive doctrine conflicts with the
Bible. Thus, you must choose — is liberal theology right, or is the
Bible?</p>
<p>They can’t both be.</p>
<p>Will you follow mans wisdom or God’s? It’s your choice. But you can’t
follow both, it’s one or the other.</p>
<p>I know this isn’t popular to say. I’m not on best seller lists. So be
it. I’ll continue to be the watchman on the wall (Ezekiel 3 and 33), and
if you fail to heed the warning it’s your problem, not mine.</p>
<p>List of absurd ideas I’ve talked about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Post-modern philosophy</li>
<li>Phony gospel of social justice</li>
<li>Deutero-Isaiah hypothesis.</li>
</ul>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
