This is similar to the standard "3-clause" BSD license, except for the
addition of a clause stating modified versions must be marked. The GPL and
LGPL carry this requirement as well.

==========================================================================

License terms are either in the source itself, or in a separate file in each download
available. This page is for reference only; refer to the source code or file for
the actual license as code can be under either a BSD-like license or a GPL 
license â€” each project contains its own specific licensing information.
