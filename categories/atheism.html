    <dd><p>Al Stefanelli (Georgia State Director of American Atheists) sure stepped in it big time, and displayed for all the world atheism’s complete lack of understanding logic and critical thinking.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/06/atheists-unhinged.html">Atheists Unhinged</a></dt>
    <dd><p>New York wants to memorialize seven firefighters who died on 9/11 (a good thing) by renaming a street “Seven in Heaven Way.” Who could have a problem with that? Enter stage left, atheists trying to stamp out all religion based on their illogical and unprovable dogma. Where’s the tolerance?</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/04/national-day-prayer-ruled-constitutional.html">National Day of Prayer Ruled Constitutional</a></dt>

    <dd><p>Richard Dawkins when asked for his definition of morality responded “Moral philosophic reasoning and a shifting zeitgeist.” That basically means whatever society says is moral, or value relativism.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/05/bill-maher-show-intolerant-atheists.html">Bill Maher Show and Intolerant Atheists</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Bill Maher may hold strange views, but one thing we admire him for—he’ll state his views straight out, without any attempt to sugar coat it or show tact (at least he’s honest and proudly proclaims his views.</p></dd>

    <dd><p>It’s even funnier (actually sad) they take their God-denying rants *seriously*.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/03/atheism-poison-liberal-theology.html">Atheism and the Poison of Liberal Theology</a></dt>
    <dd><p>For some reason, atheists aren’t happy unless they convert religious people to their dogma. Why? I don’t know, but they frequently display intolerance, expressing a deep conviction to win converts to the religion of atheism.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/03/avoiding-logical-error-there-no-god.html">Avoiding Logical Error - There is No God</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Atheists frequently don’t recognize contradictions while attempting to defend the logical inconsistencies created by atheism. Atheists claim there is no God; after the statement is made (usually as an unproven “fact”), and the logical contradictions of that statement are pointed out to them, instead of admitting they made an error they go to great lengths to disavow the problem.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/03/avoiding-logical-error-science-confirmation-bias.html">Avoiding Logical Error - Science and Confirmation Bias</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Errors in logic must be avoided if you wish to have an open mind and use critical thinking. This of course means you must be open to all possibilities, forming opinions based on logic and analysis instead of preconceived ideas; confirmation bias can arise during analysis by making assumptions based on what you want to see, instead of evidence and logical deduction.</p></dd>

    <dd><p>Atheism doesn't work, so a god must be required. How do you determine which god?</p></dd>

    <dd><p>Atheism as dictionary defined is illogical by definition. It holds nothing but immature gibberish. Of course, atheists don't like to admit that, but it's simple to show.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/01/definitions.html">Definitions</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Before discussion atheism, we should define our terms, because some people use atheism with non-standard definitions.</p></dd>

    <dd><p>Atheists display some strange ideas. They'll complain about religious holidays ... but still take the day off.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/12/problem-morality-where-does-it-come.html">The Problem of Morality - Where Does It Come From?</a></dt>

    <dd><p>Some atheists finally admit the logical absurdity of stating “There is no God”, but attempt to weasel out of the problem by claiming practically we can state there is no God (or, almost certainly there is no God), because they don’t have proof meeting their requirements.</p></dd>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
