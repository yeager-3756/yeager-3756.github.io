    <dd><p>You’ve probably heard the majority of scientists believe something, therefore it must be true. After all, the science is settled. Should we accept it because the majority of highly trained and experienced scientists believe it to be so?</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2014/05/the-intersection-of-philosophy-and-theology.html">The Intersection of Philosophy and Theology</a></dt>
    <dd><p>The introduction to logic noted logic’s basic rule: the law of non-contradiction — something can’t be true and false at the same time. In spite of how obvious that is, it’s surprising how often someone argues…</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2014/04/formal-fallacies.html">Formal Fallacies</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Formal fallacies are the dry things you should have learned in high school. Unfortunately they're still important to understand, as they're committed quite often.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2014/04/logic-101-introduction.html">Logic 101 — Introduction</a></dt>
    <dd><p>The ability to think clearly (logic) isn't taught in school much anymore. Perhaps that's why we see so many people easily duped.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2014/04/the-fatal-flaw-in-deutero-isaiah.html">The Fatal Flaw in Deutero-Isaiah</a></dt>
    <dd><p>The Deutero-Isaiah hypothesis is an absurd idea and is trivially easy to disprove. Instead, they rely on the the old standby: hand-waving.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2013/10/logic-101-avoiding-doublethink.html">Logic 101 — Avoiding DoubleThink</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Doublethink as defined by Orwell is defined as the ability to hold conflicting ideas and accept both of them. As absurd as that sounds, it frequently occurs, and is something to be avoided.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2013/06/is-hell-immoral.html">Is Hell Immoral?</a></dt>
    <dd><p>The idea a loving God would *never* send people to hell leads to incorrect conclusions. Hell is not immoral.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2013/06/truth-isnt-relative.html">Truth Isn’t Relative</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Value relativism is the idea truth is a personal thing, and your truth isn’t necessarily anyone else’s truth.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2013/05/atheism-and-confirmation-bias.html">Atheism and Confirmation Bias</a></dt>
    <dd><p>A reader sent me an article called “Belief and the Brain’s God Spot,” which stated “belief in a higher power is an evolutionary asset that helps human survival.” Stunning. A textbook example of confirmation bias — the logical error of seeing any data as proof of your cause.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/11/problem-of-evil.html">The Problem of Evil</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Atheists try to escape the absurdity of their position by silly arguments, some even go so far to attempt *proof* God doesn’t exist. But those attempts always fail as they fall into the same logical problem.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/11/post-modern-philosophy-church.html">Post-modern Philosophy and the Church</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Post-modern what? Exactly — you need a bit of background to understand how people claiming to be Christians can deny so much of what the Bible actually says, justifying the contradiction by an infection of post-modern philosophy.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/08/do-you-make-these-5-mistakes-conversation.html">Do You Make These 5 Mistakes in Conversation?</a></dt>

    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/07/political-correctness-contradictions.html">Political Correctness Contradictions</a></dt>
    <dd><p>The politically correct crowd likes to boast about tolerance and acceptance of others, but if you’ve ever disagreed with them you’ll quickly discover how far their intolerance will go to defend their anti-definition of tolerance.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/05/logical-error-confirmation-bias-cognitive-dissonance.html">Logical Error: Confirmation Bias and Cognitive Dissonance</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Everyone has bias. The trick is not letting those ideas prevent you from seeing the truth.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/02/logical-errors-argument-authority.html">Logical Errors: Argument from Authority</a></dt>
    <dd><p>The argument from authority is one of the most common errors, usually said like most doctors agree... Learn to spot (and avoid) this error.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2011/01/never-underestimate-persons-ability-rationalize.html">Never Underestimate a Person's Ability to Rationalize</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Chuck Missler says never underestimate a person’s ability to rationalize, or justify the unjustifiable, or attempt (poorly) to reconcile contradictory beliefs.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/10/exercise-logic.html">An Exercise in Logic</a></dt>
    <dd><p>How often do you see these common logical errors in clear thinking?</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/10/beware-authority-scholars.html">Beware Authority of Scholars</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Christians are warned in the Bible to do their own homework and check things out for themselves. Many dangers exist for those failing to perform their own research, but one of the more common arises as the “argument from authority” error, frequently used in advertising as you see a doctor promoting a car or something else (Remember the Camel ads? “What cigarette do you smoke, Doctor?” More Doctors smoke Camels than any other cigarette). Obviously, a doctor doesn’t necessarily have any more expertise in automotive matters than anyone else. Advertising sometimes seeks to make a subtle connection between the two, “trust me, I’m a doctor.”</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/01/question-beginnings.html">The Question of Beginnings</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Perhaps one of the oldest questions is how did I get here? You have 4 choices.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2010/01/freethinkers.html">Freethinkers</a></dt>
    <dd><p>“Freethinking” may be popular, but it’s an oxymoron as so-called freethinkers exclude things they won’t talk about or consider (god).</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/10/proof-gods-existence.html">Proof for God's Existence</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Proofs for God's existence (or not) will never really satisfy. If God exists, He's by definition supernatural, so natural proofs won't ever be possible.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/06/what-doublethink.html">What is Doublethink?</a></dt>
    <dd><p>We’ve referred to doublethink several times, but many have asked what exactly it consists of. Surely it doesn’t really exist, as Orwell wrote a fictionalized account of a future government in “1984”. No, it really exists…</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/06/pseudo-scholarship-even-atheists-dismiss.html">Pseudo-Scholarship even Atheists Dismiss</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Scholars occasionally display such absurd ideas it's hard to believe anybody falls for them.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2009/06/didactic-dialectic-thought.html">Didactic and Dialectic Thought</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Didactic versus dialectic isn't an abstract debate. It affects you in everyday conversation. Ever wonder why some people won't hold to normal definitions? They're likely recently educated in government schools, and haven't been taught how to think clearly and logically.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2008/07/big-tent-myth.html">The &quot;Big Tent&quot; Myth</a></dt>
    <dd><p>We received an email recently comparing two religions and asking if God was the same, why the different messages (specifically about who Jesus is). But implicit in the question is one assumption: religions speak of the same god, and in spite of differences, have the same core&amp;nbsp;foundation.</p></dd>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
