    <dd><p>Most won’t be sad to see 2020 end. It’s been a strange year to say the least as joining the sad list of divisive issues Christians split over has been covid and the way the church meets. What must the church learn after the disastrous 2020 to avoid repeating history?</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2020/11/tyranny-versus-responsibility.html">COVID and Responsibility — It’s Not Tyranny</a></dt>
    <dd><p>After over eight months of facts and hard data, how (and why) do so-called pastors ignore reality and instead push politics over the people they’re supposed to watch out for? Early in the pandemic when not much was known about covid-19 they might have had an excuse for inaction.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2020/08/mask-madness.html">Mask Madness</a></dt>
    <dd><p>During the covid pandemic, mask-shaming has suddenly become a thing, with a new word added to our vocabulary. What does it reveal about those doing the attacking? Perhaps more that you might think at first.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2020/07/covid-crazy.html">Covid Crazy</a></dt>
    <dd><p>The great pandemic of 2020 caused considerable disruption in life. Sadly, the church fell into chaos as well. As this isn’t the first pandemic (and won’t be the last), what general principals must we learn from this, as if we don’t learn from history the church will be doomed to repeat it.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2015/04/its-the-cross-stupid.html">It’s The Cross, Stupid</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Staying on message isn't just for politics. Christians should stay on message as well, and not get bogged down in liberal theology sidetracks.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2015/03/are-you-at-peace.html">Are You At Peace?</a></dt>
    <dd><p>You know what? People don't really change much. The same problem the disciples faced thousands of years ago is the exact same problem we frequently encounter — and we react the same way they did. Isn't it time to learn the lesson and be at peace.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2014/11/are-you-sure-you-should-be-doing-that.html">Are You Sure You Should Be Doing That?</a></dt>

    <dd><p>Watching political events it's clear where we are today is a product of decades. Sadly, when people sounded the alarm many years ago they were ignored.</p></dd>

    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2014/08/christian-atheism.html">Christian Atheism</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Christian atheism? Could anything be so contradictory? Discover the reality of Christian atheism — people actually write books on the subject. As usual, it relies on post-modern philosophy to avoid being laughed out of the room, in spite of its absurdity.</p></dd>

    <dd><p>The average pew-warmer in church is un-trained, un-prepared, and unable to perform their combat role, providing little more usefulness than zombie food. The surprising reason? They listen to their pastor too much.</p></dd>

    <dd><p>The pain wasn’t too bad, my first thought was crap, this will make Saturday’s Taekwondo tournament a whole lotta fun — I hope it’s not too stiff by then.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2014/03/you-cant-have-a-pony.html">You Can’t Have a Pony</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Well, as it turns out, you *can*. While visiting the Tatums (Lindsey wrote the foreword for my book Stay in the Game, but you still don’t get a pony) I managed to stay on a horse…</p></dd>

    <dd><p>Our town’s water is legendary for its badness. It’s hard as a rock, and tends to eat through almost anything, leaving brown stains and disintegrated metal behind. It’s not unsafe, but not very appealing either, containing…</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2014/01/captain-were-passing-crush-depth.html">Captain, We’re Passing Crush Depth!</a></dt>
    <dd><p>It seems every submarine movie includes standard scenes. After the opening credits the sub cruises at normal depth — the crew relaxed and having fun. Later during combat, the sub sinks — past crush depth, pegging the depth gauge. All is feared lost.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2014/01/having-a-bad-day.html">Having a Bad Day?</a></dt>
    <dd><p>We all have bad days. Being able to maintain proper perspective makes the difference between a bad day and a bad attitude.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2014/01/what-al-gore-and-ed-begley-can-teach-you.html">What Al Gore and Ed Begley Can Teach You In 2014</a></dt>
    <dd><p>No matter what you think about global warming, everyone agrees Al Gore remains a polarizing figure promoting his global warming dogma. Surprisingly, the Goracle provides valuable lessons applicable to your Christian life, and shows global warming…</p></dd>

    <dd><p>One piece doesn't get much mention, but it's your weapon to impact battles far away, like long range artillery.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2013/09/protect-your-head.html">Protect Your Head!</a></dt>
    <dd><p>The Helmet protected the head from cavalry attacks, as riders on horseback used a wide, blunt sword to split skulls of those walking beneath them. Obviously, if you take such a blow to the head you’re in big trouble, so how is the condition of your helmet?</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2013/09/how-are-your-shoes.html">How Are Your Shoes?</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Any slip while engaged in hand-to-hand combat is probably your last. Thus having proper footgear is vital.</p></dd>

    <dd><p>The Roman breastplate covered the chest and those hard-to-live-without organs — heart, lungs, etc. Lacking advanced medicine, a blow through the ancient breastplate usually proved fatal.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2013/08/stay-in-the-game.html">Stay In The Game!</a></dt>
    <dd><p>I recently returned from a Taekwondo tournament, and it’s always fascinating to watch people react — especially parents toward their kids.</p></dd>

    <dd><p>I just returned from a business trip to Houston. One thing you should know … I *hate* travel. My idea of travel involves traversing the six miles from our town to the next (which has a grocery store).</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2013/02/mission-preparedness.html">Mission Preparedness</a></dt>

    <dd><p>2013 is supposed to be better than 2012, right? After all, isn’t that what everyone hopes for? Hopes, yes, realizes … sometimes not so much.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/12/nuts.html">Nuts!</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Evil exists even if people want to live in Fantasyland and blame everyone and everything *except* the perpetrator for the evil done.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/11/next-man-up.html">Next Man Up</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Oregon Football redefined the game. Not just for lightning quick scores, up-tempo offense, and staggering point totals. The real difference comes from Coach Kelly and his philosophy, one of those ideas being how to handle individuals in a team game.</p></dd>
    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/10/a-question-of-faith.html">A Question of Faith</a></dt>
    <dd><p>In the midst of trials, people might wonder where God is. After all, we've been praying, where is God? Is my faith not sufficient? Am I not doing it right? Is something else wrong? Perhaps nothing is wrong — the answer comes from Paul’s letter to the Romans, so hang on a bit for the answer.</p></dd>

    <dt><a href="https://www.dyeager.org/2012/10/lose-the-weight-part-one.html">Lose the Weight: Part One</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Today’s Christian requires a weight loss program. Not for the body (though many of us might need that as well), but the spirit, as too many people lug around excess baggage — and that’s not good for running a race if you want to win.</p></dd>

    <dd><p>Man always looks for the holy grail, or in this case, the free lunch -- the idea you can get something for nothing. Politically, government handouts and increasing debt with no consequences. But it doesn't work. Life is hard, and requires effort.</p></dd>

    <dd><p>Frequently in the church it’s difficult to get anyone to staff volunteer positions. If you’ve ever been involved in staffing, you’re familiar with all the usual reasons — young children at home, new job, school, and more. Getting out of service for God isn’t a new idea, rather it began way back in the Bible. How far back?</p></dd>

    <dd><p>Not much ever changes — human behavior remains basically the same over thousands of years. Sure we give it different names and labels, but underlying behavior doesn’t change much. Thus, when Jesus walked the earth we’d expect to see Him encounter groups similar to groups today.</p></dd>

    <dd><p>Christians will soon have to make a choice: follow the phony reality of The Matrix, or stand on the rock of God’s Word. Unfortunately, those calling for Christians to accept man’s philosophy miss an important point: man’s best ideas continually change — remember when using leaches was considered good medicine?</p></dd>

    <dd><p>Very few people would disagree public education is anything other than a failure as it gets worse and worse. A new study *proves* college fails in the most important idea to teach: learning how to learn, with logic and critical thinking.</p></dd>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
