    <dd><p>Wait a minute, God is all-powerful and all-knowing, so he can do anything, right? It turns out that’s not true — some things God can’t do. The problem comes from thinking all-power means the ability to do anything. To use the philosophical argument: Can God create a rock so big he can’t move it?</p></dd>

    <dd><p>Some disputes over doctrine are petty and disruptive, but we must agree on the major issues or you don’t have Christianity. If someone is confused on sin, the Gospel, salvation, Jesus, Hell, and so on, they’re not really Christians at all, even if they can spout the lingo at church potlucks.</p></dd>

    <dd><p>It’s easy to confuse the law, Law, and LAW. Worse, not everyone uses the same capitalization, so when you see someone talking about law, you must think — which law are they talking about? Normally the context makes clear, but Law and LAW frequently are used interchangeably, and that’s not correct.</p></dd>

    <p class='book-description'> A terrible disease infects many Christians by believing life is easy and God grants everyone (with enough faith, that is) a Lexus, ice cream, and a pony. When life gets tough people hide the pain and frustration created by the paradox of what they think the Christian life should be—versus the reality they experience—by transforming into Tony the Tiger, where everything is grrrrreat! Yet everyone needs help sometimes.</p>

  <p class='book-description'>When trials arrive, it’s a myth you’ll rise to the occasion, rather you’ll sink to your level of preparation. If you’re bringing (metaphorically) a knife to a gun-fight, you’ve set yourself up as a pig going to slaughter. Zechariah and Haggai appear about the same time to encourage the people to rejoin the battle, providing practical advice you can use today. It’s time to transform from a 98-pound spiritual weakling to a seasoned combat-ready Christian, because Christianity is — and always will be — a full-contact experience (whether you know it or not).</p>

   <p class='book-description'>Daniel’s book contains more than mystical prophecy and Sunday School flannel-board stories, as Paul reminds us “whatsoever things were written in earlier times were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the scriptures, might have hope”. Daniel’s character was unwavering, as he decided early in his life to maintain his devotion to God, no matter the cost. That’s the real lesson to learn, and Daniel’s book provides the blueprint.</p>

    <p class='book-description'>The Corinthians had their share of problems, among them marriage and divorce, divisions, pride, legalism, spiritual gifts, immorality, and more. Unfortunately the church hasn’t learned from Paul’s letter as the same mistakes repeat over and over … and over. Have you thought about how people outside the church see it today? Their responses reveal much about the state of today’s church — and it’s not good — as the problems at Corinth continue today.</p>
